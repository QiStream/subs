1
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,467
Now, we must decide
which prince to place on the throne.

2
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,594
We must establish a new ruler

3
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,472
so that we can persuade
and rally the other scholar-officials.

4
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,850
The prince we will place on the throne
is Yi Yeol,

5
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,560
Grand Prince Dowol.

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,520
They're plotting against the king.

7
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,938
We must move up the plan.

8
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,565
We'll gather the exiled officials and...

9
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,984
Lady Sukeui,
Chief State Councilor Han Seung-rok...

10
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,487
If we raise an army, there is a chance.

11
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,864
We act for what is right,
not for the odds.

12
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,283
Delay will only bring more suffering
to the people.

13
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,160
We must rally the officials first.

14
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,370
Without a settled court,
this turmoil will continue

15
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,830
even under a new ruler.

16
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,458
That can be discussed
once the throne is secured.

17
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,126
Using force is not an option.

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,378
Power can only be checked
by greater power.

19
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,547
I agree. Bloodshed is inevitable.

20
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,217
Bloodshed? We are not like
the military officials of late Goryeo.

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,719
Even if it ends in failure,
what we stand for will remain.

22
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,639
That's right.
Somebody will continue the fight.

23
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,059
That was quite heated, wasn't it?

24
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,314
Why...

25
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,733
Grand Prince Dowol?

26
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,278
A scoundrel, an idler,
a philanderer, a wastrel.

27
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,572
That's what they call him.

28
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,284
He must have had to hide his true self
behind those disgraceful nicknames.

29
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,580
Until his final moments,

30
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,916
the late king sought
to depose the Crown Prince,

31
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,127
and establish Grand Prince Dowol
as the rightful heir.

32
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,587
And now, I understand why.

33
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,756
He must have seen the makings of a king

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,049
in the young prince.

35
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,761
The makings of a king?

36
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,305
His kind heart for the people.

37
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,725
It's what the current king doesn't have.

38
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,396
You've seen it too.

39
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,524
When you were stealing for the sick,

40
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,442
when you brought
corrupt officials to justice,

41
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,279
and when you were helping
the people at the leper camp,

42
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,907
the Grand Prince was always by your side.

43
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,163
It was also deeply moving

44
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,790
when he stepped forward before the king
to save your brother.

45
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,501
It's the power of love.

46
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,807
As you said,
I know Grand Prince Dowol well.

47
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,101
So I know he will not join your plot.

48
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,273
We will keep our existence hidden
from the Grand Prince.

49
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,360
We will offer him the throne
once we succeed in overthrowing the king.

50
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:15,945
May I ask why?

51
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,908
If we include the Grand Prince in the plot
and fail,

52
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,201
he will be beheaded immediately.

53
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,995
And that must not happen

54
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,247
so that there will be another chance.

55
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,876
So the Grand Prince must remain alive

56
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,670
until the next attempt
because he is meant to become king?

57
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,972
From what I saw today,
with so few officials and scholars,

58
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,557
this is bound to fail.

59
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,184
There will be nothing but death ahead.

60
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,560
We will fight regardless.

61
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,979
Even if all that awaits us

62
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,981
is death.

63
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,277
Is this not your resolve as well,
Gil-dong?

64
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,175
You're wrong, Lady Sukeui.

65
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,052
I won't let this body

66
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,346
die like that.

67
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,644
Let's go.

68
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,937
Somewhere far from the palace,

69
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,063
somewhere far from Joseon.

70
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,742
I...

71
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,245
can't go.

72
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,418
You already

73
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,087
knew.

74
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,511
You already made up your mind.

75
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,222
You were already

76
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,349
with them.

77
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,236
Sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

78
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,948
I needed time to understand

79
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,326
why they are trying to change the world,

80
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,119
and why my lord challenged His Majesty,

81
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,288
risking his own life.

82
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,748
And?

83
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,542
Those people are fighting to survive.

84
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,377
And my lord

85
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,797
probably tried to help
people like them survive.

86
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,383
And?

87
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,260
If we go back to our own bodies,

88
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,970
I'll join them as Gil-dong.

89
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,930
They're using you
because you're a commoner.

90
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,848
I know.

91
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,893
Once you're caught as a traitor,
you'll be torn limb from limb.

92
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,352
I'm prepared for that.

93
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,315
How can you

94
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,444
speak of your death
so lightly in front of me?

95
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,243
Because the new king they want

96
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,913
is you.

97
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,584
So you should also--

98
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,502
No.

99
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,172
You're wrong.

100
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,591
What do you mean?

101
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,135
If you choose
to become a traitor as Gil-dong,

102
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,471
I'll stand with the royal family
as the Grand Prince.

103
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,891
They're defying the royal traditions
upheld for generations

104
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,894
and trying to overthrow the realm
and its king.

105
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,230
I can't let them do that.

106
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,023
So I have learned.

107
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,819
But--

108
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,404
I will never be the traitors' king.

109
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,156
Which means this plot

110
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,367
is bound to fail.

111
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,079
That is my decision.

112
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,184
Eun-jo, it's your mother. I'm coming in.

113
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,982
You must be tired.
Finish up and go to bed.

114
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,900
After this.

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,111
What are you writing about?

116
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,739
We will fight regardless.

117
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,324
Even if all that awaits us

118
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,034
is death.

119
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,914
I'm trying to give your daughter
a long and healthy life.

120
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,043
How long do you want to live?

121
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,714
Until "happily ever after"

122
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,676
becomes her ending.

123
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,412
Remove her.

124
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,580
I beg Your Majesty's mercy.

125
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,541
I beg Your Majesty's mercy!

126
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,627
I will reorganize the courtesans.

127
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,548
Geum-nok's cold has lasted quite a while.

128
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,801
She's getting her strength back now.

129
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,526
I was really worried
after you left like that.

130
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,777
You must be conflicted, but--

131
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,571
No, my head is clear.

132
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,699
I'm only thinking about
how I can bring the plotters down.

133
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,287
What is it?

134
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,545
The names of the plotters
I saw with your eyes last night.

135
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,298
What will you do with this?

136
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,136
What do you think will happen
if I take this to the king?

137
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,598
They'll all be killed.

138
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,769
That's not like you.

139
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,605
If you want me to stay as I am,

140
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,440
then stop me.

141
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,779
If you change your decision
to stand with them,

142
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,323
no one needs to die.

143
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,993
I'll give you one day.

144
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,786
You make the decision.

145
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,968
One day?

146
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,654
Thanks.

147
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,155
Take care.

148
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,410
I must follow him.

149
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,091
This is...

150
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,675
Is this Chief Secretary Im's house?

151
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,513
Why did Chief Secretary Im's guard

152
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,224
approach the fake Gil-dong's body?

153
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:28,437
One. The Chief Censor
wrote Gil-dong's name before he died.

154
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,774
Two. The fake Gil-dong was killed
by an arrow before he was arrested.

155
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,236
Three. The person who approached
the fake Gil-dong's corpse

156
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,612
was Chief Secretary Im's guard.

157
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,366
But why?

158
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,035
Wait.

159
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,914
What if there was intent
behind their actions?

160
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,042
One. The murderer of the Chief Censor
had to be Gil-dong.

161
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,462
Two. The fake Gil-dong
had to be arrested after his death.

162
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,800
Three. Chief Secretary Im's guard had
to get rid of the fake Gil-dong's body.

163
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,884
Why?

164
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,679
Because the Chief Censor was murdered by...

165
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,560
Chief Secretary Im.

166
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,484
Did you do as I said?

167
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,115
What kind of incense is this?

168
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,540
It will

169
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,585
bring peace to the king.

170
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,559
Wouldn't it be better
if I went to find him?

171
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,479
I know this house well.

172
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,106
And I'm a pretty elusive thief, you know.

173
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,317
I seriously can't get used to this.

174
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,445
Whether you are His Highness or Hong-si,

175
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,363
when I give you the signal,
come out at once.

176
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,662
If the secret had to be kept
at the cost of the Chief Censor's life,

177
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,039
it must be a pretty serious one.

178
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,665
At least in Joseon...

179
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,468
What is taking so long?

180
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,599
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,017
You'll wake up soon.

182
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,247
Your Highness?

183
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,414
What are you doing here?

184
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,124
Please help me.

185
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,626
I must head to the palace now.

186
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,972
What are you stealing
from my family's annex?

187
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,477
Lady Jang?

188
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,062
Put your sword down.

189
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,148
I forgot to shout

190
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,067
that I found a thief.

191
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,404
This woman is not an object
that can be stolen

192
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,365
or an animal to be hung or mistreated.

193
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,159
Hung?

194
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,996
Tell the Chief Royal Secretary

195
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,331
that this woman went
where she wished to go.

196
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,794
Put that down.

197
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,597
Let's go.

198
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,234
Wait.

199
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,446
Before we reach the palace...

200
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,406
Why were you held at his house?

201
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,493
Apparently, he can't stand a lowborn

202
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,163
having ideas of her own.

203
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,249
Is that it?

204
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,918
She had been tortured for days.

205
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:19,835
Later.

206
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,132
You look even paler now.
Are you all right?

207
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,428
This won't do.

208
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,056
Let's get a horse from the constabulary.

209
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,223
Yes, Your Highness.

210
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,399
A house call at this late hour?

211
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,901
They said it's urgent.

212
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,453
It looks pretty bad.

213
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,876
- What are you doing?
- I...

214
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,295
I think I should leave.

215
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,673
I refuse to be in a women-only area.
It's inappropriate.

216
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,049
What are you saying?

217
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,592
Start from there.

218
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,845
You see, I know you wouldn't understand,

219
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,766
but I'd be out of my mind to stay here.

220
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,935
Pull yourself together, will you?

221
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,354
I know you haven't
quite been in your right mind

222
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,231
since what happened to your lord.

223
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,316
So I overlooked all the mistakes you made.

224
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,277
But I can't do that now.
Can't you see how bad things are here?

225
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,916
Could you go a little lower?

226
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,045
Here?

227
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,047
Can I just take it off?

228
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,257
I'm a bit uncomfortable.

229
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,550
I'm uncomfortable.

230
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,886
Here?

231
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,598
How is it now? Does it feel better?

232
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,434
You've got the strength of a man.

233
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,395
You've got good instincts.

234
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,188
Pardon?

235
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,691
Does it hurt anywhere else?

236
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,277
The horse is not for His Highness?

237
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,238
It's a long story.
Lady Jang will ride the horse.

238
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,033
Geum-nok.

239
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,077
Lady Jang is here?

240
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,584
Your Highness.

241
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,363
It's been a while.

242
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,533
Do you know each other?

243
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,539
We once held each other's hands

244
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,958
and eloped together.

245
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,090
Here.

246
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,009
I should get going.

247
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,316
It was before I started wearing
the courtesan wig.

248
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,612
Why did you choose
not to elope with Aide Park?

249
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,073
I wanted to become

250
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,450
the most powerful woman in Joseon.

251
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,994
Your dream came true.

252
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,579
You're now His Majesty's woman.

253
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,081
Let's run away.

254
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,374
Somewhere far from the palace,

255
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,667
somewhere far from Joseon.

256
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,213
You chose not to run away
with the man you loved.

257
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,297
Have you ever

258
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,341
regretted that?

259
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,760
Never.

260
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,106
One day,

261
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,650
I may be able to repay this debt.

262
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,010
Is the cold messing with your mind too?

263
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,888
Could we speak in private?

264
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,557
Geum-nok?

265
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,726
I could not stop the Grand Prince.

266
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,859
How much does the Grand Prince know?

267
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,374
Go and tell Seung-jae that

268
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,587
if something bad happens to me,
he should do as I previously ordered.

269
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,923
Something bad? What will you do?

270
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,801
Nothing.

271
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,978
I will do nothing
but wait here for His Majesty's order.

272
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,858
Is this perhaps related
to the bedchamber matter you mentioned?

273
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,404
What are you plotting?

274
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,464
His Majesty has granted you an audience.

275
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,485
Your Majesty.

276
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,033
Sit.

277
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,328
Sit on the throne.

278
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,590
It's a royal order.

279
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,839
Breathe it in

280
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,758
deep into your lungs.

281
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,972
Your Majesty.

282
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,861
Everything I did was for Your Highness.

283
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,655
Same old excuse.

284
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,910
Your role was to be my loyal dog.

285
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,331
That is why

286
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,917
I became the greatest flatterer in Joseon.

287
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,628
You've enjoyed enough power
pulling the strings.

288
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,004
Now,

289
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,507
humbly accept your death.

290
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,400
This is what you wanted me to be.

291
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,657
You surrounded yourself
with ministers who bowed to you,

292
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,660
and brought all the worldly pleasure
into the palace for yourself.

293
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,577
Am I wrong?

294
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,748
What lame final words.

295
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,168
Your trembling hands are your curse.

296
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,505
When did you quit that poison?
A few hours ago?

297
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,383
Tonight, your body
will be wracked with pain and tremors,

298
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,427
and you will beg for the poison
before dawn,

299
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,720
just as you always have!

300
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,347
Soon, all of Joseon

301
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,808
will witness your madness.

302
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,936
To the ministers
who have turned against you,

303
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,855
your madness will serve

304
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,523
as the perfect justification.

305
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,156
I'm talking about your fall.

306
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,783
Do you understand?

307
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,660
In all of Joseon,

308
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,954
there's only one person
who wants you on the throne!

309
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,914
It is I!

310
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,918
I am the only loyal subject you have!

311
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,814
The Chief Secretary?

312
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,400
It seems like he locked Lady Jang up
to manipulate her,

313
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,070
since he couldn't kill
His Majesty's concubine.

314
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,074
The king's favorite concubine
and the sycophant are at odds now?

315
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,283
I wonder why.

316
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,999
You know what?

317
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,168
I also wonder why you did this.

318
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,795
What?

319
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,381
So, last night,

320
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,466
you broke into Chief Secretary Im's house

321
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,135
instead of making the decision
you're supposed to make.

322
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,638
You don't care about what I say, do you?

323
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,431
I don't think so.

324
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,808
I warned you.

325
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,851
If I don't get your answer today,

326
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,145
I'll hand over
the list of traitors tomorrow.

327
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,483
Do you think I can't do it?

328
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,196
One day is too short.

329
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,156
What?

330
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,659
I thought about it over and over
before making that decision.

331
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,287
I can't go back on it overnight. I won't.

332
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,831
Fine.

333
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,875
If you can't do it, I'll stop it myself.

334
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,133
Let go.

335
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,636
I can't.

336
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,238
I can't let you go either.

337
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,539
There's no reason to rush yet.

338
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,083
I can't do anything
while our bodies are switched anyway.

339
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,835
Right now, I'm the Grand Prince.

340
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,464
I know. Right now, I'm Gil-dong...

341
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,008
Exactly.

342
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,928
We can talk about it
once we're back in our own bodies.

343
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,224
Then I wish we never go back.

344
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,851
Because I will never do anything

345
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,270
under that famous name of yours.

346
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,065
Let's do that.

347
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,442
I'll live as you for the rest of my life.

348
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,059
Tonight, your body
will be wracked with pain and tremors,

349
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,020
and you will beg for the poison
before dawn.

350
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,022
Play the music louder!

351
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,399
My ears are ringing!

352
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,183
I am the only loyal subject you have!

353
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,811
They are your people, Your Majesty.

354
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,939
Please remember his sincerity.

355
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,899
That's the only thing I wish for.

356
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,780
Bring her in.

357
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,574
May I ask whom, Your majesty?

358
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,870
Hong Min-jik's daughter.

359
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,917
I hear you are
Min-jik's concubine's daughter.

360
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,923
Yes, Your Majesty.

361
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,266
Your spirit isn't that of a lowborn.

362
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,560
It must come from your father.

363
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,355
That must have been his teaching.

364
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,525
From what I know,

365
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,778
he was a man who treasured people,

366
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,572
never judging them
by their birth or learning.

367
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,284
He was.

368
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,331
That's why he treated me,
a dethroned queen's son,

369
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,125
like a human being,

370
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,127
unlike my other teachers.

371
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,425
Why did you send me for, Your Majesty?

372
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,181
To remember

373
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,475
his sincerity.

374
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,954
Is this what someone

375
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,206
who remembers him would do?

376
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,050
Your Highness,

377
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,219
even at this very moment,

378
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,264
the capital is filled with
the cries of people being exploited.

379
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,474
Outside the capital,

380
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,352
the sick cry out in anguish
suffering from the plague,

381
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,898
and the streets are filled
with the tears of orphaned children.

382
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,317
Please listen to them.

383
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,068
Listen to the people, not the flatterers.

384
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,071
That is the duty of the throne.

385
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,450
You're right.

386
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,912
My teacher sent you here.

387
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,790
I still have a loyal subject!

388
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,089
I told you not to stop!

389
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,674
Please stop!

390
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,094
They can barely stand.
Their bodies are worn to the bone.

391
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,139
For my new loyal subject,

392
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,352
I shall throw a feast!

393
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,529
Physician Hong?

394
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,339
The music sounds nice.

395
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,008
It sounds so nice that

396
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,052
I can't hear anything from outside.

397
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:51,970
Your Highness!

398
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,684
Hong-si was in His Majesty's bedchamber.

399
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,643
What?

400
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,840
We were locked in the palace,
not allowed a single drop of water.

401
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,259
We had to dance like that all day.

402
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,597
I broke a bone,

403
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,934
and His Majesty didn't even care.

404
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,121
I've been looking for you.

405
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,457
You went to His Majesty's bedchamber.

406
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,336
Are you all right?

407
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,006
No.

408
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,968
What's wrong?

409
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,388
Let's steal them.

410
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:18,806
Steal what?

411
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,226
His Majesty's women.

412
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,149
I need you to meet

413
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,359
my mother and the Queen Consort for me.

414
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,403
If this continues,

415
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,697
all the courtesans
will die by tomorrow night.

416
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,075
I need Your Majesties' help.

417
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,537
I'm sorry.

418
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,708
If things go wrong,

419
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,918
tell him it was my order.

420
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,880
I'm his mother by law.
He won't go so far as to kill me.

421
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,131
Let it be my order.

422
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,886
I ordered the women be kicked out,
blinded by jealousy.

423
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,640
I'm his wife in name only,

424
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,475
but he won't cast me aside.

425
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,602
Your Majesty.

426
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,107
Please go now.

427
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,692
You must save those women.

428
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,370
I need you to discreetly get the clothing
of the eunuchs and court ladies.

429
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,955
Yes, Your Majesty.

430
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,088
Do as I said.

431
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,399
Who are you

432
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,151
right now?

433
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,487
Unfortunately, it's still me.

434
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,740
Your Highness, please sit here.

435
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,452
I have something important to tell you.

436
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,875
Why don't we go see the moon?
We didn't get to see it last time.

437
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,175
Get out of here.

438
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,597
I'm here to help you.

439
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,940
This is as far as I can go. Escape safely.

440
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,069
Let's go.

441
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,304
Where are the courtesans?

442
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,098
We are going
to His Highness' private villa.

443
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,105
Intruders! Close the palace gates!

444
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,948
Try to stay in the palace if possible.

445
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,247
I received the message. What happened...

446
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,750
- A sword? Why--
- I'll explain on the way.

447
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:08,929
I must stop here.

448
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,848
Please take care.

449
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,224
Physician Hong.

450
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,772
I'm sorry I'm late.

451
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,484
Let's go.

452
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,283
They are nowhere to be found.

453
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,540
If this was planned,
they must be outside the capital by now.

454
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,503
- We will go to the port.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

455
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,434
- Clear the way!
- Yes, sir!

456
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,228
Move!

457
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:09,073
Your Majesty, I'm Shin Hae-rim,
the Queen Consort's niece.

458
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,867
I saw Your Majesty at the your wedding.

459
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,787
Yes, I remember.

460
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,291
I'm out to see the moon today.

461
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,753
May I ask where you are headed,
Your Majesty?

462
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,716
Oh, dear. The beautiful moonlight
must have distracted me.

463
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,137
What are you doing? His Majesty is here!

464
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,139
His Majesty?

465
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,723
His Majesty!

466
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,977
His Majesty!

467
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,359
Clear the way at once!

468
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,643
Physician Hong!

469
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,657
Get down.

470
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,509
Listen to me.

471
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,803
The boat won't leave
until you're all aboard.

472
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,181
So run for your life. Don't look back.

473
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,313
I'll run till I collapse.

474
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,357
If I get caught, I'll die anyway.

475
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,401
I would've died tomorrow anyway
from all the dancing.

476
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,864
I might as well die
running around here like a lunatic.

477
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,076
All right. One.

478
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,788
Two.

479
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,169
Three.

480
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,736
Over there. Fire.

481
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,208
Stop them!

482
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,062
Hurry.

483
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,699
It's an archer!

484
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,993
Stay in formation!

485
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,078
Watch out for the archer's arrows!

486
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,204
Yes, sir!

487
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,875
Physician Hong.

488
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,251
Over there.

489
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,438
You had to come, after all.

490
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,823
Physician Hong!

491
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,075
Come on! Run!

492
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,201
Now!

493
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,915
Come on! Run over here!

494
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,440
It's over.

495
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,689
Stop them at all costs,
even if it means killing them!

496
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,525
Kill them all!

497
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,868
Your Majesty.

498
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,294
"If you chase those women,

499
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,797
the next arrow will pierce your heart."

500
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,472
How did he aim from this distance?

501
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,771
It's the assassin from that day.

502
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,673
If you leave now,
you'll at least save your life.

503
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,490
Please run.

504
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,707
Leave me be.

505
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,543
I will not beg for my life.

506
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,044
I'll be the one who begged.

507
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,381
I appreciate your intention,

508
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,342
but I do not have a reason to run.

509
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,511
Are you going to die like a dog here?

510
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,430
Like some lowborn?

511
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,735
Tell Seung-jae that

512
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,903
I am

513
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,823
coming back soon.

514
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,853
There's only one person
who wants you on the throne!

515
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,938
It is I!

516
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,474
Bring

517
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,185
the Chief Secretary.

518
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,075
His Highness said
it would just be for a while.

519
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,660
Don't worry.

520
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,953
They may search all of Joseon,

521
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,205
but this is the last place they'd come.

522
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,500
A courtesan named No-eul was with us,
but she was left out.

523
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,752
We don't know if she's alive.

524
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,588
Go look for her.

525
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,840
Yes, Your Highness.

526
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,759
I mean, yes, I will.

527
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,720
Thank you so much.

528
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,180
Thank you. Thank you.

529
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,770
Since the courtesans
vanished into thin air,

530
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,439
I hear the investigation has stalled.

531
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,817
It is probably beyond their imagination

532
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,652
that the Grand Prince
would ever help them.

533
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,448
Thank you.

534
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,033
It wasn't the most pleasant night
to see the moon.

535
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,288
I was just so excited

536
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,374
that I could do something for them
as the same woman.

537
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:54,134
His Highness once told me here

538
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,554
that there was a woman
he could never forget.

539
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,931
I have always wondered

540
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,435
how one could be so deeply etched

541
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,854
in a man's heart.

542
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,399
But I think I know now.

543
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,615
It's because that woman is you, Eun-jo.

544
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,537
It's Your Highness in there now, right?

545
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,539
It's just a formality.

546
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,627
Should I say "no more formality" too?

547
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,003
It is Your Highness.

548
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,715
Whoever did this, ghost or god,

549
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,843
I wonder why they tied you to this fate.

550
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,389
I asked myself the same question
the other night.

551
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,150
It happened every time
my life was threatened.

552
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,946
Does that mean that,
if you were to return to your bodies,

553
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,906
one of you would have to be
in danger again?

554
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,242
It's just an assumption for now.

555
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,328
For now, at least.

556
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,007
One night,

557
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,469
I searched for an answer

558
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,430
as to why our souls had to be switched.

559
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,808
If that's the reason,

560
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,101
why would we...

561
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,312
Perhaps I knew it then.

562
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,405
Do you still feel the same way?

563
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,116
- What do you mean?
- About them and--

564
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,451
No.

565
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,870
My answer hasn't changed.

566
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,247
I should get going.

567
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,002
Why won't you be honest with me?

568
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,755
You're just running away

569
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,256
from the world.

570
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,508
Just be honest with me.

571
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,385
You're avoiding me now.

572
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,388
Because you're scared.

573
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,223
Because you're scared.

574
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,364
You're right, I'm scared.

575
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,074
I'm scared to lose you.

576
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,412
Even now,

577
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,582
the palace is filled with music every day.

578
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,126
In the past,

579
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:20,173
when others said that the world
was indifferent to our suffering,

580
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,592
I held onto a faint hope that

581
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,637
those high in the palace
must surely be doing something

582
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,889
to make the world a better place.

583
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,975
But I know I was wrong,

584
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,394
now that I've lived your life.

585
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,356
It wasn't the world that was indifferent.

586
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,525
It was

587
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,278
the man on the throne.

588
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,701
Now, you know

589
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,161
the very things I wished
you didn't know about my life.

590
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,917
You have lived my life too,
so you must know

591
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,460
that in a world like this,

592
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,713
I have no choice but to live as a thief.

593
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,841
No.

594
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,719
You're wrong again, Hong Eun-jo.

595
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,893
I...

596
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,398
I...

597
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,283
I will never let you live as a thief.

598
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,277
Have you made up your mind?

599
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,655
I will make a world

600
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,786
where I don't need to live

601
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,496
as a thief.

602
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,560
The Left State Councilor,
Im Sa-hyeong, is entering.

603
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,292
Your Highness,

604
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,004
there is a reception for envoys
hosted by the royal relatives today.

605
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:08,675
Right.

606
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,641
It's pretty far away.

607
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,519
They're holding the banquet
in a place with a beautiful view.

608
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,242
Have the royal relatives not arrived yet?

609
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,994
They have all arrived.

610
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,944
It can't be...

611
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,676
No.

612
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,557
One night,

613
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,684
I searched for an answer

614
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,353
as to why our souls had to be switched.

615
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,774
Perhaps I knew it then.

616
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,235
Ever since our souls were switched,

617
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,278
perhaps I knew that...

618
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,365
Look at that shameless face of yours,
just like your father's.

619
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,954
...fighting against your ordeals...

620
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,539
Thank you.

621
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,541
Thank you!

622
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,875
Stop!

623
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,088
...protecting your people,

624
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,556
and taking the world with you
was the fate laid out before me.

625
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,143
Perhaps I also knew that one day,

626
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,189
I would die for you as well.

627
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:33,945
And if that's my fate,

628
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,574
I will gladly accept it.

629
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,114
Are you here?

630
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,824
If you can hear me, answer me!

631
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,242
Please!

632
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,119
Don't sleep for too long.

633
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,457
Congratulations.

634
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,709
Since I am to succeed Father
as Chief Royal Secretary,

635
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,670
I would like to begin
in Father's court robes.

636
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:33,838
It's a royal order.

637
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,840
Anyone who sees Gil-dong

638
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,468
is to kill him on the spot.

639
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,888
Your Highness and I
are no longer protecting the same thing.

640
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,389
Do your best.

641
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,725
What I protect has never changed.

642
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,062
