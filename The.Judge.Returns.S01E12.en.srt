00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,951
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,120
EPISODE 12

3
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,346
Please open your arms.

4
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,063
Your phone, please.

5
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:09,777
Please follow me.

6
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,665
Hello, sir.

7
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,837
We've met, haven't we?

8
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:29,505
Yes.

9
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,926
I heard you'd be taking
Tae-sik's case in court.

10
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,095
That's new to me.

11
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,973
You'll hear about it soon enough.

12
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:47,231
The limit is 500 million won per year.

13
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,703
I'd like you to sentence him
to five years in prison.

14
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,708
And he'll get the three-and-five sentence
in the appeals trial.

15
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,668
A three-year sentence, suspended for five.

16
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,422
That's nothing new, you know?

17
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,844
Unless you want to check
how I spend every penny of this

18
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:19,513
you can give the money to me in cash
after the trial.

19
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,931
No need to leave traces.

20
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:27,980
Have a good day.

21
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,568
My phone, please.

22
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,869
I met Mr. Jang Yong-hyeon.

23
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,580
He told me to sentence Tae-sik
to five years in jail

24
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,083
while handing a credit card
with a 500 million won limit.

25
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,170
He can be so impatient.

26
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:52,963
Five years in the first trial

27
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,549
and three years in prison
with five years on suspension in the next.

28
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,635
That's the magic formula
for conglomerates.

29
00:02:58,427 --> 00:02:59,929
- So?
- Tae-sik's case involves

30
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,390
a few hundred billion won
with the illicit loans and slush funds.

31
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,184
It's not a case to be handled
by a single-judge criminal court.

32
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:08,604
I didn't answer him,
as I didn't have your permission yet.

33
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,776
Tae-sik will soon be indicted
while in custody.

34
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,697
A panel of judges will take on the case,
so sort it out there.

35
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,491
Don't worry about the lead judge.

36
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:22,660
Conduct a legal review
and finalize the sentencing order.

37
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,706
Oh, you might as well be promoted
to a Presiding Judge for this.

38
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,543
But I'm not sure

39
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,170
how long his sentence should be.

40
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:38,092
Sin-jin has no interest
in giving Yong-hyeon what he wants.

41
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:40,094
Give me an answer,
and that'll be my verdict.

42
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:42,346
Didn't you hear me?

43
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:45,224
I thought I'd already answered you.

44
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:51,939
I'll follow the law.

45
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:53,983
But wouldn't that cause issues?

46
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,569
Don't look for justice
through questions and debates.

47
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:58,362
Show me your justice

48
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,990
the equity and common sense

49
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:05,119
that everyone knows in their hearts.

50
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,291
I was going to get rid of them all

51
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,877
once I became the leader of Suojae,
anyway.

52
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,173
You may go.

53
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,301
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,145
Have you decided?

55
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,069
Mr. Jang has more accounts under an alias,
aside from those at Jeongdaun.

56
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,113
I'll give you half of the funds there.

57
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,574
So, 20 billion won. But promise me...

58
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,747
I'll be safe

59
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:52,082
after all this.

60
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,960
Of course.

61
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,505
Tell Yong-hyeon

62
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,925
exactly what he wants to hear.

63
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,971
Let Tae-sik take the fall
for the slush funds

64
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,557
but you take care of the illicit loans

65
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,851
without Tae-sik hearing about them.

66
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,275
Think of it as being extra loyal.

67
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,486
Come on.

68
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,905
Open an account.

69
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,408
I'll give you a bonus.

70
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,369
Sir...

71
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,957
I might lose my license to practice law.

72
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,004
You don't earn much
with that license, anyway.

73
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,008
I'm your pot of gold, not your license.

74
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,177
Me, Jang Yong-hyeon.

75
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,721
Trust me.

76
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,432
Judge Lee has been assigned to the case

77
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,227
and Mr. Kang told him to sentence Tae-sik
to five years in jail.

78
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,106
As he should.

79
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,067
Make sure your testimony matches

80
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,152
that of the loan officer
at Jeongdaun Savings.

81
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,031
And make sure Tae-sik isn't involved
in the illicit loans.

82
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,242
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, sir.

83
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,621
You're basically family to S Group now.

84
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,874
Congratulations.

85
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,918
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

86
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,068
We're representing Mr. Jang,
the CEO of S Shopping, in court.

87
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,405
Han-young will be on the panel of judges.

88
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,826
He may be an associate judge

89
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,954
but he'll dictate the verdict.

90
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,125
Make a team and take on Tae-sik's case.

91
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,170
Me?

92
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,214
- Really?
- Why are you so surprised?

93
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,966
It's about time you get some experience.

94
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,053
Maybe start dressing up, too.

95
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,892
Are you on the panel of judges
for Mr. Jang's trial?

96
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:18,312
Haenal Law Firm is really in
on all the secrets.

97
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,605
Of course.

98
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,274
Dad wants me to make a team
to represent him.

99
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,612
Eat up. It's on me today.

100
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:29,365
If this is your bribe for Mr. Jang's case,
I don't want it.

101
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:34,078
Have you already forgotten about my help
with the Miracle scam?

102
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:37,289
You asked for a meal at my house
in return for your help

103
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,041
which you got.

104
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:42,086
That means neither of us owes anything
to each other, Ms. Yu.

105
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:44,213
Fine.

106
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,631
I get it.

107
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,759
But why do you keep calling me "Ms. Yu"?
It's like we're strangers.

108
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:50,719
Are you distancing yourself from me?

109
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,348
Seriously.

110
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:55,766
I just want to...

111
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:57,810
Gosh, I wish I could just punch you once.

112
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,019
Just one punch, please?

113
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,814
Why? Was the slap on our first date
not enough?

114
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:03,607
I should've hit you more then.

115
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,275
Don't take Tae-sik's case.

116
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,695
I've already agreed to take it.

117
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,407
Mr. Kang is behind Han-young joining
the panel of judges.

118
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,034
He's got S Group's back.

119
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,787
It'll just be
a five-year sentence in prison

120
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,872
so just don't mess up.

121
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,624
Aren't you sentencing him
to five years in jail?

122
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,294
We'll bust S Group entirely

123
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,714
starting from Tae-sik
to his father's slush funds.

124
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,425
We're shaking up the whole conglomerate,
so don't get involved.

125
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:31,593
Really?

126
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:38,475
Yes, Lee Han-young speaking.

127
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:43,814
I made Yi-seok the Chief Justice,
as you suggested.

128
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:46,900
Looks like you'll soon have
the Chief Justice as your legal advisor.

129
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,527
Congratulations.

130
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:53,949
I once ran

131
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,452
like there was no tomorrow.

132
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,747
Are you a professional runner?

133
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,831
No.

134
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,752
If you're not a professional

135
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,421
why are you running so hard?

136
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,133
What?

137
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,306
I couldn't answer him.

138
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,600
I didn't know why I was running so hard.

139
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:25,189
And I definitely didn't know
when to stop or where I was.

140
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,443
But I started living a different life

141
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,989
and finally realized
why I had to keep running.

142
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,412
I know why I have to keep running now.

143
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,583
To become a better person

144
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,961
for my family

145
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,590
and the person I love.

146
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,218
And for myself.

147
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,022
What kind of a life

148
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:10,943
did you live before?

149
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,154
Someone said

150
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,906
I was garbage.

151
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,825
"Garbage"?

152
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:21,203
Come on. There's no way.

153
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,376
Don't take Tae-sik's case.

154
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,504
Let your brother or sister take it.
Let them be greedy.

155
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,631
Is it

156
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:35,217
really that bad of a case?

157
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:41,640
What do you want to do

158
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,685
once the law firm becomes yours?

159
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,191
Well...

160
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,238
That's...

161
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,968
Why didn't I think of that?

162
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:32,357
Let's go.

163
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,609
Let's run!

164

SEONJIN HAPPINESS FOUNDATION

166
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:05,724
We have to turn it on.

167
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,353
CHAIRMAN KANG SUN-CHEOL

168
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,272
- Huh?
- What's wrong?

169
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,566
The password is "123456."

170
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,109
It's basically unlocked.

171
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,653
- Huh?
- What?

172
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,071
Go ahead.

173
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,077

UNOFFICIAL ACCOUNTING LEDGERS

175
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,039
I found it!

176
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:33,585

00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,407
He's just like me, huh?

180
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,117
UNOFFICIAL ACCOUNTING LEDGERS
FOR JANUARY TO AUGUST 2025

181
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:06,910
MOVE TO THE USB DISK

00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,662
MOVING 8 ITEMS TO THE USB DISK

183

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

184
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,459
Mission accomplished.

185
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,718
Hey, Mr. Park.

186
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,470
I'll send the fraudulent ledgers
from Seonjin to you.

187
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,264
Okay.

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

189
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,207
LETTER OF INDICTMENT
YOU ARE INDICTED AS STATED BELOW

190
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,878
PRINT

191
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,807
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KANG JI-HWAN

192
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,392
DETAILS REGARDING THE DEFENDANT

193
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:14,686
What's this?

194
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:17,064
He takes money from elders
who collect scraps

195
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,566
and kids who collect every penny they get

196
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:21,693
for his drinking parties every night.

197
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,613
Don't you know
giving non-profits a bad rep like this

198
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:27,032
makes people stop donating,
even to good charities?

199
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:30,369
Think of it as an opportunity cost
for our society and stop here.

200
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,453
Our society?

201
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,414
For whom in our society?

202
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,043
A significant portion
of the donations goes

203
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:42,589
to a borrowed-name account
of an unidentified person.

204
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:44,591
I told you to stop, alright?

205
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:02,192
Do you get a share of the donations, too?

206
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,028
Cheol-woo!

207
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,284
Do you want to get fired right now?

208
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:13,912
You want me to leave you
with absolutely nothing?

209
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:15,831
Why can't you just say it's not true?

210
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,958
It's not true, you bastard!

211
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,543
Who gets the money, then?

212
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,507
Why are you asking me?

213
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,969
Get this out of my face

214
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:31,430
unless you want to get fired right now.

215
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,777
Our country's prosecution is rotten.

216
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,446
Why? Were you told you'd be fired?

217
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,907
- Did you spy on me?
- I didn't need to.

218
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,826
Here comes another one.

219
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,627
Daejin Daily says

220
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,796
we can't publish a word about this.

221
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,217
And the reporters from other agencies ran
the minute I mentioned the foundation.

222
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,722
They don't want to tackle Seonjin
because Gwang-to is the face.

223
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,893
Does that make any sense to you?

224
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,104
Those who don't know
what Gwang-to is really like think

225
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,274
he's just a kind, former President
who always thinks of his people.

226
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,195
Cheer up.
You knew it wasn't going to work.

227
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,613
- No, I didn't!
- No, I didn't!

228
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,281
I was sure we could do this.

229
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:32,532
We found fraudulent ledgers!

230
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,242
How can we not investigate it?

231
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:40,332
Did you tell us to do this,
knowing we'd fail?

232
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:42,375
Did you really?

233
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:47,672
The corrupt are resilient.
It only hardens under outside pressure.

234
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,425
To break it, we have to trigger
a fracture from the inside.

235
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:53,845
Now that they know
the press and the prosecution are on it

236
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,388
they'll start to get on it, too.

237
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:57,182
Then, once they realize

238
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,267
things aren't going as they'd expected

239
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,019
they'll start to split up.

240
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:04,606
Then, the corrupt will finally break.

241
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,567
You used us as baits.

242
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,694
He definitely did.

243
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,446
I guess I'm the hook.

244
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,657
Are you the worm?

245
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,867
- Don't put it like that.
- No, krill.

246
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,245
I don't know how he got it

247
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,329
but Prosecutor Park has

248
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,040
the Seonjin Foundation's
fraudulent ledgers.

249
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,417
I don't think he's going to stop.

250
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,839
We should've gotten rid of him
when we got rid of Jeong-tae.

251
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:33,718
It'll get messy if he keeps this up.

252
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,265
Should we get on it now?

253
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,227
I hear Cheol-woo is asking
to investigate the foundation.

254
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,856
If anything happens now,
the whole world will watch them.

255
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,738
We have no choice

256
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,783
but to face it.

257
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:14,301
We've never met, have we?

258
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,762
No, but I know who you are.

259
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,609
There's an opportunity cost

260
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,736
to establishing justice.

261
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:39,242
Does it also cost people's lives?

262
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,665
That's not nice.

263
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:49,127
I didn't know there was a price tag
to achieving justice.

264
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,050
What's justice to you, Mr. Park?

265
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,844
Arresting all bad guys, no matter what.

266
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,638
That's what justice is to me.

267
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:02,057
I like how simple it is.

268
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,561
You want to strike the Seonjin Foundation?
I can help you.

269
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,566
Arrest the Chairman
for embezzlement and breach of trust.

270
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,445
Would that establish justice for you?

271
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:20,867
He's using the Chairman as a sacrifice
for the foundation.

272
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,329
What do you think?

273
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:30,418
Let's accept the sacrifice first,
as Sin-jin wants.

274
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,087
And then?

275
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,839
We'll sprinkle salt
before the wound heals.

276
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,821
Kwak Sang-cheol,
the opposition party's hitman.

277
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,739
He's known as the "crazy dog"

278
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,450
for all his bluntly honest whistleblowing
and slander.

279
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,663
Mr. Lee Han-young?

280
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,499
Thank you for coming.

281
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,547
The future son-in-law of Haenal
wants to discuss party nominations.

282
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,590
Who would say no to that?

283
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,468
I'm guessing it's not for free.

284
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,555
I need you to attack someone.

285
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:28,768
I guess Haenal has an enemy?

286
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,396
No, this has nothing to do
with the law firm.

287
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,856
The target is

288
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,066
Park Gwang-to, the former President.

289
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,823
Are you out of your mind?

290
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:44,868
Your ammo is corruption
in the Seonjin Happiness Foundation.

291
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,370
Mr. Former President isn't a man

292
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,498
who will fall with just one shot.

293
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,042
But he'll reek of blood
where the bullet hits him.

294
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,502
And that's enough for me.

295
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,964
Oh, so

296
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,551
I'll leave him a scar,
and you'll rip it open?

297
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,304
Okay, I see what you want now.

298
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:07,599
How can you guarantee
that my party will nominate me?

299
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:10,185
You'll be the hitman of the opposition

300
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:12,896
who uncovers
the former President's misconduct.

301
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,984
That'll earn you all the popularity
to become a presidential candidate.

302
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,404
What?

303
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,075
So, I have to do all the work
to get what I want?

304
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,661
But I'll give you all the tools
for the job.

305
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,927
ACCOUNTING LEDGER

306
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:48,223
Wow.

307
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:51,059
This is some consistent effort

308
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,854
involving some big money.

309
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,316
I know.

310
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,283
You know

311
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:12,747
I always wished I'd gone to school.

312
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,792
So, I collected scraps and sold them
to save money.

313
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:21,464
I donated that
to the Seonjin Happiness Foundation

314
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,593
in hopes that it'll help students
who can't afford education.

315
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:28,346
But look at this.

316
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:29,639
My gosh.

317
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,141
They took that money

318
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,270
to drink at hostess bars

319
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,231
for millions of won a night!

320
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:41,776
How can this be real?

321
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,236
Unbelievable...

322
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,405
MR. PARK GWANG-TO!
WHAT'S YOUR CONNECTION TO THE FOUNDATION?

323
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:47,282
I can't believe it.

324
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:49,951
I've been fooled. Unbelievable.

325
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,453
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR KANG YEONG-BEOM,
WHO DONATED TO THE FRAUDULENT NON-PROFIT

326
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,081
MR. PARK GWANG-TO!
WHAT'S YOUR CONNECTION TO THE FOUNDATION?

327
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,378
It takes a cart full of scraps

328
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:02,463
to make 10,000 won

329
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,008
at the junkyard.

330
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,846
Mr. Kang worked tirelessly for that money

331
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:14,684
only for all of it to be spent
on the Chairman's night of drinking.

332
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:18,187
Not only do I feel enraged

333
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,524
but more than that,
I also feel Mr. Kang's despair and pain.

334
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:23,610
Therefore

335
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:27,572
I'd like to ask Mr. Park Gwang-to,
the former President.

336
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,532
Mr. Park

337
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:35,914
what's your connection
to the Seonjin Happiness Foundation?

338
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:39,751
Each month, 10% of the donations are seen

339
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:43,129
getting withdrawn
to a borrowed-name account.

340
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:45,089
Does that account belong to you?

341
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,091
Bang!

342
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,847
Who owns the borrowed-name account

343
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:55,558
that takes 10% of all donations?

344
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,061
Answer me, Mr. Park.

345
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:00,313
To whom does the account belong?

346
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:03,524
- Whose account is it?
- Answer us!

347
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,235
I'm sorry.

348
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,994
Mr. President!

349
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,080
I'm so deeply sorry...

350
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:19,415
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

351
00:24:22,418 --> 00:24:24,420
I'm sorry. I can't believe what I've done.

352
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,805
Damn you!

353
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,015
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:41,521
What's your plan?

355
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,564
The Deputy Prosecutor General is
on our side

356
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,608
so you won't get an arrest warrant.

357
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,528
And the press?

358
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,279
Don't worry.

359
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,824
Every news agency has
some sort of a lawsuit.

360
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,411
Sang-cheol, that crazy bastard!

361
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,122
I should've gotten rid of him sooner!

362
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,207
When the time is right

363
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,503
beat him and skin him.

364
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:06,879
Yes, sir.

365
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,552
It's Mr. Do, my assistant.

366
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:14,470
- Pick it up!
- Yes, sir.

367
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:17,640
Hey, it's me.

368
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,475
What?

369
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,439
They're doing a search and seizure.

370
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,898
- A search and seizure?
- Yes, sir.

371
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,692
Hang up, you bastard!

372
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,488
Mr. Kang!

373
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,907
Mr. Kang...

374
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,826
What's going on?

375
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:38,494
Take everything from there.

376
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,829
There's a second floor, right?

377
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:41,789
This is the prosecution.

378
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,750
We're doing a search and seizure
of the Seonjin Happiness Foundation.

379
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,043
Please cooperate with us.

380
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,753
Stay calm and collect everything.

381
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:52,842
Please stop.

382
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:55,094
- This is mine.
- Please stop it.

383
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:57,055
What's going on?

384
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,350
Is the Deputy Prosecutor General crazy?

385
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,227
Call him right now. Hurry.

386
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:05,146
It's the Deputy Prosecutor General.

387
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:10,276
What?

388
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:17,533
This morning,
the prosecution did a search and seizure

389
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,620
of the Seonjin Happiness Foundation
and seven of its facilities

390
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:22,705
to investigate alleged corruptions.

391
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,333
Chairman Kang Sun-cheol
of the foundation is

392
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,793
- under an arrest warrant
- Are you kidding?

393
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,795
- breach of trust and embezzlement.
- Pass it.

394
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,797
According to the prosecution...

395
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,424
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

396
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:36,636
Take back the arrest warrant right now

397
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,930
and stop the search and seizure
of my foundation!

398
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,224
What?

399
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,934
Who?

400
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,394
The President's order?

401
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,900
The former President, Park Gwang-to,
is allegedly involved in land speculation.

402
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,068
This morning

403
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:54,112
the prosecution received
government documents

404
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,073
about Hanyang City's plans
to clear the green belt for development.

405
00:26:57,406 --> 00:26:58,991
According to the investigation

406
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,285
the former President got tipped
during his term

407
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,370
and purchased

408
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:04,622
some land in Hanyang in advance.

409
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:05,915
And a part of the money came

410
00:27:05,998 --> 00:27:08,501
from the borrowed-name account connected
to Seonjin...

411
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:09,836
I'm sorry.

412
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,173
Why do something you know is wrong?

413
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,262
Damn it!

414
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,392
Please forgive me, sir.

415
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:27,937
Allegations of leaking the documents
regarding Hanyang City's development plans

416
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,606
have led to questions
of every politician's involvement.

417
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,901
The prosecution announced its discovery
of 12 lots of land in Hanyang

418
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:38,698
purchased by Mr. Park Gwang-to
and his acquaintances.

419
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:40,575
Just two months ago

420
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,994
the government announced
that this area would be...

421
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:44,162
Sin-jin

422
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,540
it's your time to shine now.

423
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,920
NEW CITY PLANNING FOR HANYANG
AND CLEARING OF THE GREEN BELT IN 2027

424
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,096
TO THE NEWS DIRECTOR OF KOREA N

425
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,181
SOCIAL AFFAIRS MOBILE TEAM 2

426
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,394
- For the Digital News Team.
- Okay.

427
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,980
For the News Division.

428
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,232
For the Digital News Team.

429
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,650
TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIGITAL NEWS TEAM

430
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:20,406
ALLEGATIONS OF FORMER PRESIDENT PARK
BUYING LAND FOR SPECULATION

431
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,783
You can chop the tree or set it on fire

432
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,578
with Gwang-to hanging on
for his dear life.

433
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:27,747
Do whatever you want.

434
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,049
Whatever!

435
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,135
I can't believe Mr. Park has been summoned
for questioning.

436
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,262
It can't get crazier than that.

437
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,934
That's great for Mr. Jang Tae-sik.

438
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,144
The world will forget about him
and focus on this.

439
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:54,899
You sure you won't regret it?

440
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,279
Yeah, I don't want an easy case
from the start.

441
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,530
It's boring.

442
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,074
Right?

443
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,910
I know you don't like boring stuff.

444
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:09,538
Start by going to law school
if you want to take on real cases.

445
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,502
Jin-gwang, you can form your team
for Mr. Jang's case.

446
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:15,586
Okay!

447
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,297
We've already talked to Judge Lee,
so no need to talk to him.

448
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,388
Gosh.

449
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,276
Nam-yong came to see me.

450
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,696
He mentioned you and Judge Lee.

451
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,741
Why did you do that?

452
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,287
You were the one who suggested me
to nominate Nam-yong

453
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,122
as the next Chief Justice.

454
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,378
Our plans were all ruined
by his son turning himself in.

455
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,257
Had it not been for his son

456
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,967
he would've become the Chief Justice.

457
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,848
I won't ask about Judge Lee
and his little revenge.

458
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,309
But you know

459
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,393
if, by any chance

460
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,438
this affects me in any way

461
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:18,858
you'll be in trouble, too.

462
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,320
You're the leader of Suojae.

463
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,198
Suojae can only survive if you do.

464
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,498
The Seoul Central District Court.

465
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:36,250
Be in charge of it.

466
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,419
A Senior Presiding Judge won't be enough

467
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,464
to save me from any trouble.

468
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,348
Come in.

469
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,956
Does he look like a traitor to you?

470
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:21,170
You've chosen him to be your sidekick.
Trust him.

471
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,006
He has dark intentions

472
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,759
just like everyone else
coming in and out of here.

473
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:30,679
Okay

474
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:34,809
how about this one?

475
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,989
He doesn't look like the traitor type.

476
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,575
Hmm?

477
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,877
Who knew this issue would get so big?

478
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:06,424
Didn't expect my chance to come so soon.

479
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,762
PROSECUTION SERVICE

480
00:32:48,757 --> 00:32:50,509
You can sit there.

481
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:59,018
Sorry, our hands were tied by the press.

482
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,312
Man, this is exhausting.

483
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:11,572
It'll take some time.

484
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,702
I know that much, too.

485
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,541
Does 2 a.m. sound good?

486
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,543
Yes, sir. Once again, I apologize.

487
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:40,142
17-8, Jima-ro 38beon-gil

488
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,685
CHOI DA-EUN, MISSING
OH MIN-SU, DEAD FROM A HEART ATTACK

489
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:50,110
Nobody lives there.

490
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:55,366
Doesn't Ms. Han Gi-hyeon live here?
The teenager in high school.

491
00:33:55,991 --> 00:33:58,035
She died last year.

492
00:33:58,118 --> 00:33:59,203
Got hit by a car.

493
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:00,955
Sorry?

494
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:06,210
Excuse me.

495
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:17,179
Why are you going to every empty home?
Aren't you a reporter?

496
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,892
Doesn't Ms. Han Jong-hui,
the college student, live here?

497
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,852
College student?

498
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,146
Right.

499
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:30,359
She would've been in college,
had she been alive.

500
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:33,487
Are you saying...

501
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,117
Mr. Lee, Seonjin seems to have used
the names of the dead and missing

502
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,952
to make borrowed-name accounts.

503
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:41,328
So, we were right.

504
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:43,080
Good work.

505
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:47,126
This is Mr. Park Gwang-to's driver.

506
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,503
Sorry, I'm late.

507
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:51,755
You ordered for me?

508
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,465
Thank you!

509
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:05,477
Oh, sorry.

510
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,522
One more extra big soup, please!

511
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,648
Coming!

512
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:13,902
This is a photo of Gwang-to's driver
withdrawing money from a borrowed account.

513
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,363
But we can't be 100% sure of that.

514
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,824
Of course, it's probably 100% true.

515
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:20,826
Why don't we have news agencies
question it?

516
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:23,579
That'll be good.

517
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,419
Right on.

518
00:35:34,214 --> 00:35:36,300
Yes, there we go.

519
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,010
Go!

520
00:35:40,512 --> 00:35:41,972
Oh, no.

521
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,057
Man!

522
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,892
I guess it's over.

523
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,609
What time is it?

524
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,027
It's 1:20 a.m.

525
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,695
Do I have to stay here until 2 a.m.?

526
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,824
Let's just go.

527
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:06,997
Sorry.

528
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:09,375
You'll have to stay a bit longer.

529
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,418
What?

530
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:12,836
Ridiculous.

531
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,630
Get out of my way.

532
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,090
Come on. Get out.

533
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,177
You've just gone
from a witness to a suspect.

534
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,262
An arrest warrant has been filed

535
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,139
for allegations of you being the owner

536
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,308
of Seonjin's borrowed-name accounts.

537
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:27,893
Huh?

538
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,753
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a voicemail...

539
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:07,349
The National Court Administration
nominated someone

540
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,685
for the Chief Judge position that I left.

541
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,271
It must be Sin-jin.

542
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:13,397
That's right.

543
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:15,816
What are your thoughts?

544
00:37:20,195 --> 00:37:21,238
Appoint him.

545
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:22,740
And why should I do that?

546
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,033
Gwang-to must've nominated Sin-jin
as the Chief Judge

547
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,161
so he could save him.

548
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,164
But Sin-jin won't use the new power

549
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:31,373
to save Gwang-to.

550
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,959
Instead, he'll use it for himself.

551
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:39,339
Oh

552
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,508
and did you say

553
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,802
Gwang-to is taking shelter at Suojae?

554
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:45,262
Yes, sir.

555
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,348
Sin-jin wants to be the new leader there.

556
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,852
This fight will definitely kill

557
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,314
one or the other.

558
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:00,569
Regardless of who survives

559
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:03,405
he'll walk away with a deep scar.

560
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:17,002
CHIEF JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

561
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:25,010
There will be a meeting at Suojae today.

562
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,179
Both of you must come.

563
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,056
Yes, sir.

564
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,261
Mr. President is incapacitated.

565
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,973
We need to take action right now.

566
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:16,144
And so, I've invited
the Deputy Chief Prosecutor

567
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,146
who's acting
as the Deputy Prosecutor General.

568
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,412
I've also asked Mr. Woo Gyo-hun,
the Chair of the Judiciary Committee

569
00:39:33,495 --> 00:39:34,830
for help.

570
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,172
Congratulations on becoming
the Chief Judge.

571
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,937
Any support from To's Club?

572
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:02,941
They're providing monetary support
through borrowed-name accounts.

573
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:06,153
We need some help from corporations, too.

574
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:10,032
I'll find a way.

575
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,077
The opposition will demand
an independent counsel for Mr. President.

576
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,162
Beat them to it

577
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,289
and create an independent counsel

578
00:40:17,372 --> 00:40:19,416
to make a narrative
to counter their counsel.

579
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:21,752
Yes, sir.

580
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,632
We must stop them

581
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:29,343
from making an independent counsel.

582
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:31,595
Yes, we'll do that.

583
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:42,356
Sin-jin looks like someone
we can really count on, doesn't he?

584
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,193
The way he quickly finds solutions
and that intelligence!

585
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,654
You're right.

586
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,534
But shouldn't we also consider
the worst-case scenario?

587
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,996
What do you mean?

588
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,373
Mr. President will return

589
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,667
no matter what.

590
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,210
Of course.

591
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:07,547
But we have to think of all possibilities.

592
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,802
We have to prepare for the worst
at all times.

593
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:13,887
Don't you agree?

594
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,640
Man...

595
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,769
Let's grab a drink.

596
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,690
Bring the files.

597
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,402
Whether it be about my slush funds
or illicit loans

598
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:30,320
I'll tell you everything.

599
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:34,783
I hear you guys have to fight
for the biggest cases

600
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:37,285
for promotions and success, too.

601
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:39,788
You could've just told me that

602
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:42,165
if that was what you wanted.

603
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,334
We wouldn't have had to waste
so much time, then.

604
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:47,796
What do you say?

605
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,425
Why don't you join my side now?

606
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,385
Watch your mouth.

607
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:55,804
This is the last chance I'm giving you

608
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,807
Ms. Pretty Prosecutor.

609
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,308
The last chance?

610
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:04,730
For whom?

611
00:42:07,232 --> 00:42:10,485
No need to give me such a scary look.
It's intimidating.

612
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:12,988
So, you don't want to take my offer?

613
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,241
Sure, then.

614
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,077
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

615
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,042
Jerk.

616
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:53,028
TAE-SIK HAS BEEN DETAINED

617
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,117
Tae-sik has been

618
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,911
detained.

619
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:04,581
Han-young, join the panel of judges.

620
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:08,543
And immediately get promoted
to a Presiding Judge.

621
00:43:09,377 --> 00:43:10,378
Thank you, sir.

622
00:43:11,713 --> 00:43:13,256
Oh, and the chair I was using

623
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,467
in my old office is uncomfortable.

624
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,885
I'll get you a new one.

625
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:20,472
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

626
00:43:24,017 --> 00:43:25,102
Updates on Tae-sik?

627
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:27,104
I went to the detention center

628
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,605
and he admitted to the charges.

629
00:43:28,688 --> 00:43:29,898
As you said

630
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:31,817
it seems
that his father is sacrificing him.

631
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:33,693
Anything else?

632
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,613
Just nonsense, you know.

633
00:43:36,696 --> 00:43:39,616
He offered me the last chance for me
to join his side or whatever.

634
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,536
I was so close to throwing a punch at him.

635
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,037
I regret having held back.

636
00:43:44,454 --> 00:43:46,540
Where are you? I'm almost there.

637
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:47,624
Me too.

638
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:50,252
- See you soon.
- Okay.

639
00:43:55,757 --> 00:43:57,509
I thought Tae-sik would use that week

640
00:43:59,177 --> 00:44:02,055
to harm Prosecutor Kim.

641
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,181
Is it decaf?

642
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:06,768
Okay?

643
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:13,483
He's at the driving range all day.

644
00:44:14,025 --> 00:44:16,278
It's like he wants to go pro
before he goes to jail.

645
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,365
But Tae-sik didn't do anything
in that one week.

646
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,035
Why did he need a week, then?

647
00:44:29,749 --> 00:44:31,084
Just nonsense, you know.

648
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,004
He offered me the last chance for me
to join his side or whatever.

649
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,422
A chance?

650
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:37,591
I was so close to throwing a punch at him.

651
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:38,925
I regret having held back.

652
00:44:43,221 --> 00:44:44,514
The last chance?

653
00:44:47,392 --> 00:44:49,728
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A
AT THE CENTRAL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

654
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:52,397
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

655
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,525
The last chance... That means

656
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,236
Tae-sik just needed a week

657
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,322
to plot Ms. Kim's murder.

658
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:01,448
That means

659
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,910
Tae-sik is at the detention center

660
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,037
waiting for Ms. Kim to die.

661
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:09,122
Someone to send

662
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:12,167
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a far, far away.

663
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:17,797
And as a farewell...

664
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,092
No.

665
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,223
Oh, my phone.

666
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:54,960
Shh!

667
00:45:58,546 --> 00:45:59,756
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

668
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,383
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

669
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:18,608
Did Tae-sik tell you to kill me now?

670
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,987
That's too bad.

671
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,446
I can't die yet.

672
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,023
Are you okay?

673
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,149
Oh, gosh.

674
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,067
I'm fine.

675
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,485
Are you?

676
00:47:03,528 --> 00:47:04,529
Oh.

677
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:08,575
I definitely broke

678
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,827
Tae-sik's back.

679
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:18,460
You okay?

680
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,760
Thank you.

681
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:32,724
Jin-a!

682
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:35,477
- What's wrong with him?
- Hey!

683
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,728
Mr. Park...

684
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,607
What's with you?

685
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:42,692
That bastard!

686
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:45,945
Are you alright?

687
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,489
Yeah.

688
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,158
Are you hurt?

689
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,494
Don't be so dramatic.

690
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:54,954
I'm fine!

691
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,291
Let's head in.

692
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,545
What took you guys so long?

693
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,006
You were the last one to come!

694
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,967
Let's just go.

695
00:48:08,593 --> 00:48:09,636
What a weirdo.

696
00:48:13,014 --> 00:48:14,891
Thank goodness the scar isn't so deep.

697
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:16,059
I guess so.

698
00:48:21,439 --> 00:48:23,566
I get why he kept yapping
about my last chance.

699
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:26,444
So, he needed a week before detainment

700
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,363
to find an assassin?

701
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:32,325
Suojae is starting to fall apart
after Gwang-to's arrest.

702
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,661
Sin-jin will jump at this chance

703
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:36,329
and try to take over Suojae.

704
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,374
I guess
the real power struggle begins now.

705
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:43,753
The internal conflict will be
a great chance for us.

706
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,802
Can we kill them?

707
00:48:50,885 --> 00:48:52,262
- No.
- Fine.

708
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:01,521
I'm Byeon Jae-yeong

709
00:49:01,604 --> 00:49:04,441
Mr. Jang Tae-sik's assistant and attorney
at S Shopping.

710
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,733
The reason

711
00:49:09,737 --> 00:49:12,490
I'm here today is...

712
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,788
I'm here today, because...

713
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,512
You're sure

714
00:49:35,054 --> 00:49:36,306
I'll be safe, right?

715
00:49:39,225 --> 00:49:41,561
Mr. Kang, the Chief Judge

716
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:44,439
directly promised to keep me safe.
You know that, right?

717
00:49:58,411 --> 00:49:59,996
You bitch. You've lived for too long.

718
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:10,006
My eyes opened at the crack of dawn.

719
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,592
I couldn't wait to see you.

720
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,011
Defendant Jang Tae-sik

721
00:50:15,094 --> 00:50:16,513
used a paper company

722
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,641
to get an illicit loan of 120 billion won

723
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:23,728
and hid 50 billion won in slush funds

724
00:50:23,811 --> 00:50:25,104
at Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

725
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:27,815
Hey, didn't Byeon say he'd take the blame

726
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,567
for the illicit loans?

727
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:30,652
Why isn't he here?

728
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:32,278
I'm sure he's on his way.

729
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:35,615
What's taking him so damn long?

730
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,160
The Defendant came clean to me

731
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,704
regarding his slush funds.

732
00:50:43,414 --> 00:50:46,000
Does the Defendant agree?

733
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,546
Yes, he vows to provide full restitution

734
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,631
for the illegally-acquired profits.

735
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,509
Yeah, I promise, alright?

736
00:50:54,592 --> 00:50:57,428
Just give me five years in jail
so I can move on to the appeals.

737
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:00,932
Where's Byeon, this bastard?

738
00:51:01,766 --> 00:51:02,850
Your Honor

739
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,979
the Defendant is entirely denying

740
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,147
all allegations
regarding the illicit loans.

741
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,111
Accordingly, I'd like to move to call
an additional witness

742
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:16,281
to prove the counts of the indictment.

743
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,996
I object, as we did not agree
on this witness prior to the trial.

744
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,666
What should we do about the witness?

745
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:28,793
It is mandatory

746
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:34,591
for the prosecutor to discuss and settle
all relevant evidence and witnesses

747
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,176
with the Defendant and his attorney
in advance.

748
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,932
However, the Court may assess and agree
on evidence and witnesses

749
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:45,893
in necessary and urgent circumstances.

750
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,813
Your Honor!

751
00:51:48,896 --> 00:51:51,274
Will the prosecutor tell me more
about the witness?

752
00:51:51,357 --> 00:51:55,320
He's a witness of the Defendant's loan
of 120 billion won, taken out illegally.

753
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,657
That means

754
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,577
the witness is necessary
and urgently needed.

755
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,203
Your Honor!

756
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,955
The request for the witness is granted.

757
00:52:07,915 --> 00:52:08,958
What's going on?

758
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,668
Isn't he on our side?

759
00:52:11,669 --> 00:52:13,630
The witness won't come to speak
in court today.

760
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,340
However...

761
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:22,764
LOCATION TRACKING

762
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:34,817
- What?
- I'm Byeon Jae-yeong

763
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,027
- What is he doing there?
- Mr. Jang Tae-sik's assistant

764
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,321
and attorney at S Shopping.

765
00:52:38,404 --> 00:52:39,781
What the hell is going on?

766
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,078
A new witness will come forward
in Tae-sik's trial.

767
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,247
I've talked to the prosecution

768
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,083
so grant the request for the witness.

769
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,961
I've come to clarify

770
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,631
that Mr. Jang Tae-sik ordered me
to get the illicit loans

771
00:52:56,714 --> 00:52:58,675
at Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

772
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:03,221
However, something sits heavy in my heart,
and I'd like to make a confession here.

773
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,141
Dad probably has some slush funds
at Jeongdaun, right?

774
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,976
He wants to sacrifice me

775
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,312
because he doesn't want anyone
to mess with that.

776
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:15,358
I can't let anyone take that money.

777
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:17,110
That'll all be mine one day.

778
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,322
Fine. I'll take one for the team.

779
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:24,158
Hey, Dad.

780
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,119
What are you doing? Stop them!

781
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:27,704
Make her turn that off!

782
00:53:29,288 --> 00:53:30,581
It's too late.

783
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,377
This is where you need to listen up.

784
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,795
That bastard!

785
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:39,882
- Hey, Byeon.
- Yes?

786
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:41,801
Find someone.

787
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,511
What for?

788
00:53:43,594 --> 00:53:45,221
Someone to send

789
00:53:45,304 --> 00:53:48,558
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a far, far away.

790
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:56,983
And as a farewell...

791
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,069
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

792
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:32,769
Please sentence the Defendant
to 20 years in jail

793
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:35,146
and a fine of 20 billion won.

794
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:39,150
Please also order
a forfeiture of 170 billion won.

795
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:41,360
JUDGE

796
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,696
DEFENDANT

797
00:54:44,655 --> 00:54:46,365
And in a few days

798
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:58,085
he'll be detained once again
for instigating the murder

799
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,380
of the prosecutor who detained him.

800
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,686
All of this is a lie!

801
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,105
That prosecutor bitch is lying
about everything!

802
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,982
What the hell are you doing?

803
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,401
You're a lawyer, too!

804
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,073
He's the same man from the past life.

805
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:28,574
Let go!

806
00:55:29,575 --> 00:55:32,328
GOODBYE, YOU CRAZY BASTARD

807
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:35,832
Ms. Kim hasn't changed, either.

808
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,376
What? Did you just cuss at me?

809
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:39,502
Huh? Hey!

810
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:42,380
Lawyer! That bitch just cussed at me!

811
00:55:42,463 --> 00:55:44,715
I'll sue you for assault!

812
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,217
What did you say, you bastard?

813
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,301
Let go!

814
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,803
Let go of me right now!

815
00:55:48,886 --> 00:55:51,722
That bitch is lying about everything!

816
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:52,807
Let go!

817
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:05,736
LIBERTY MOTEL PARKING LOT

00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:19,727
Mr. Kang

819
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:23,648
there's been an issue.

820
00:57:44,418 --> 00:57:47,880
THE PRONOUNCEMENT DATE
FOR JANG TAE-SIK

821
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:55,972
DEFENDANT

822
00:57:58,724 --> 00:58:00,559
Your Honor, please read the final verdict.

823
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,487
The court will pronounce the judgment.

824
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:17,076
The verdict is ready.

825
00:58:17,576 --> 00:58:18,577
The verdict is ready.

826
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,454
The court sentences the Defendant

827
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,714
to ten years in prison and 24 billion won.

828
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:33,718
to 20 years in prison and 20 billion won.

829
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,562
The court also orders

830
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:47,857
a forfeiture of 170 billion won.

831
00:58:54,321 --> 00:58:58,284
DEFENDANT

832
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,936
Great work, Ms. Kim.

833
00:59:42,828 --> 00:59:45,956
COURT

834
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:00,012
Dad

835
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,641
I put Tae-sik in jail today.

836
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:07,812
Aren't you proud?

837
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:15,361
Meanwhile, the prosecution found

838
01:00:15,444 --> 01:00:18,697
slush funds of Jang Yong-hyeon,
the Chairman of S Group

839
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,952
in its investigation of Jeongdaun Savings
for Mr. Jang Tae-sik's slush funds.

840
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:24,328
The prosecution is focused

841
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:26,956
on the possibility of Chairman Jang

842
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:30,417
hiding huge wealth using
borrowed-name accounts and affiliates.

843
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,503
The prosecution may extend
the investigation

844
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:35,589
to the whole Jang family.

845
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,926
Things are looking pretty terrible
right now.

846
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:41,554
You need to give us more time.

847
01:00:54,191 --> 01:00:55,442
This is the prosecution.

848
01:01:04,451 --> 01:01:05,703
Mr. Jang Yong-hyeon

849
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,747
you're under emergency arrest

850
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,709
on charges of creating slush funds,
tax evasion, bribery

851
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,377
and violations of the Political Fund Act.

852
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:37,943
Here comes Mr. Jang Yong-hyeon.

853
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:43,699
The enemies will start striking back now.

854
01:01:56,795 --> 01:01:58,339
Okay, got it.

855
01:02:04,094 --> 01:02:05,095
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

856
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,430
Who's behind this?

857
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:08,098
Why does that matter?

858
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:11,852
You thought you'd be fine
after messing with S Group?

859
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:13,938
If you don't want to get fired, go.

860
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,315
- Right now.
- On it.

861
01:02:21,737 --> 01:02:23,697
EMPLOYEE PASS FOR KIM JIN-A
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

862
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,213
Come in.

863
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:43,008
May I?

864
01:02:50,182 --> 01:02:51,600
No need to pity me.

865
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,143
I'm excited to leave.

866
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,354
I know. But where are you going?

867
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,439
Hyenam or something.

868
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,943
Maybe it's a vacation for doing so well.

869
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,781
I won't wait long, okay?

870
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,701
We still have a lot to get done.

871
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,916
- You need help?
- I'd appreciate it.

872
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:18,043
Please pack this.

873
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,595
Is it for leaking case files?

874
01:03:29,638 --> 01:03:31,432
Can you not always get it right?

875
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,809
I saw it coming the moment I gave Ms. Song

876
01:03:33,892 --> 01:03:35,686
the photo
from the security camera footage.

877
01:03:35,769 --> 01:03:37,855
No need to feel sorry... Why...

878
01:03:37,938 --> 01:03:39,648
- Here...
- Come on.

879
01:03:40,774 --> 01:03:42,401
It's okay. It looks cute.

880
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:44,987
I can't believe I look like a panda.

881
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,573
Where are you off to?

882
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:49,950
I thought you knew everything.

883
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,328
I hear Ms. Kim is going to Hyenam.
You, too?

884
01:03:53,078 --> 01:03:54,580
They both hate us, so no.

885
01:03:55,247 --> 01:03:57,666
I'm not telling you where I'm going.
Don't call me, okay?

886
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:01,545
You're not going to tell me? Okay.

887
01:04:02,546 --> 01:04:05,632
You're just leaving now?
That's just disappointing.

888
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:08,677
Wherever you're going,
you'll be back soon, anyway.

889
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,846
- Huh?
- See you soon.

890
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:15,059
But I...

891
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:18,312
So, if I'm coming back...

892
01:04:18,395 --> 01:04:19,563
I...

893
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,067
Gosh.

894
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,083
Good work.

895
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,710
Didn't I tell you

896
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,921
I'd bring you back to Suojae
as soon as possible?

897
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:29,466
Alright.

898
01:05:32,886 --> 01:05:33,887
Congratulations

899
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:37,182
on your safe return, Mr. President.

900
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:46,316
THE JUDGE RETURNS

901
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,483
Sin-jin's rebellion has begun.

902
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,067
Call a meeting at Suojae tonight.

903
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,153
We'll get rid of it
if it looks problematic.

904
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,197
I never trusted you from the start.

905
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:34,823
You don't have anywhere to run.

906
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:38,327
So, we'll have to give what Sin-jin wants.

907
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,329
He killed a man!

908
01:06:40,412 --> 01:06:42,956
So, you approached me for me.

909
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,541
I think I'm getting blamed.

910
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,502
This is the last chance.

911
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,378
It won't take long.

912
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,672
I was ready to go all the way
when I started, anyway.

913
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,929
