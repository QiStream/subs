00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:34,992
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:38,328
EPISODE 6

3
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:47,755
Hello, I'm Lee Han-young.

4
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:49,173
I'm Yu Seon-cheol.

5
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:51,383
Please, you don't need to be so formal.

6
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,385
Seon-cheol

7
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,306
your life is in my hands now.

8
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:07,107
PROSECUTOR GENERAL EOM JUN-HO

9
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:12,362
I'll make Prosecutor General Eom

10
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:15,365
Haenal Law Firm's legal advisor.

11
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:20,037
What did you say?

12
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:29,963
Mr. Eom, the Prosecutor General, sir?

13
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,882
You really don't need to be so formal.

14
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:34,176
I have no idea what you're talking about.

15
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:36,303
Dad!

16
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:47,564
What is this guy doing here?

17
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:49,358
Did you invite him?

18
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,818
I'll tell you later.

19
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:52,528
- You can head out for now.
- No.

20
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:55,155
Why should I leave
when my old date is here?

21
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,240
Get out.

22
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:57,783
Come on!

23
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:00,744
Drop by my office before you go.

24
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:02,496
Okay?

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,623
You can join us.

26
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:06,250
I'm here to see you, anyway.

27
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:08,877
Mr. Eom will become

28
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,089
Haenal Law Firm's legal advisor,
without a doubt.

29
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:13,674
What are you saying?

30
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:16,426
I wouldn't want anything more than that.

31
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:18,262
But

32
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:20,264
what's in it for you?

33
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:22,474
Hire an attorney for Ms. Yu.

34
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:25,519
For our very own Ms. Yu not to have one

35
00:02:25,686 --> 00:02:26,937
as a Team Manager is

36
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:30,149
a little embarrassing, you know?

37
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,110
"Our Ms. Yu"?

38
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:35,988
Don't call me that!

39
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:37,990
Come with me right now.

40
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:39,283
Come on!

41
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,201
I need my briefcase!

42
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:44,204
My gosh!

43
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:53,297
Prosecutor General Eom...

44
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,342
Man.

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,645
How are you going to make Mr. Eom
work for us?

46
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:10,814
He's turned down every law firm

47
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:12,900
including this one, you know?

48
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:14,860
Oh

49
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,029
are you trying to impress me?

50
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:19,948
Just keep your head down
and come to me when it's time.

51
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:24,077
But don't even think
about acting like my husband

52
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,704
physically and emotionally.

53
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,708
And going forward...

54
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,752
Was she always so chatty?

55
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:32,836
No.

56
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:36,006
Actually, just don't come again.

57
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:38,133
I'll just see you at our wedding.

58
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,598
Wait, why am I holding this?

59
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:46,099
Here.

60
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,351
Get out already, then.

61
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:50,896
What are you doing?

62
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,022
Huh?

63
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:55,525
I need your help

64
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,236
to get Mr. Eom to join this firm.

65
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,114
- Sorry?
- I'll call you later.

66
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:12,918
What?

67
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:17,923
What the hell?

68
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:49,496
Huh?

69
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,042
Honey, get me a towel!

70
00:04:57,212 --> 00:05:00,299
I told you to take one on your way in.

71
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:03,510
Stay there! You're getting water all over.

72
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:05,595
What's the towel doing there?

73
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,180
Maybe it grew legs and ran away.

74
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,265
What?

75
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:11,018
Let's see.

76
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:13,270
Where are your legs?

77
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:14,521
Han-young

78
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:16,606
do you want to shower or eat first?

79
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,358
I just started making some stew.

80
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,027
Back then, I had no idea

81
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,237
how much I'd miss

82
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,906
her precious voice.

83
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,117
I'll eat first.

84
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,462
Han-young, have you seen the legs

85
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,464
on our towels?

86
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,215
What legs?

87
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:45,385
Your mom said my towel grew legs and ran,
but I couldn't find them.

88
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,388
Where did they go?

89
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,307
- Right there.
- Where?

90
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,391
Right there.

91
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:52,476
Oh, it's running.

92
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,560
- Here.
- Huh?

93
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:54,644
Han-young

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,064
don't play along with his jokes.

95
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:58,315
You're spoiling him.

96
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,448
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

97
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:14,706
Sin-jin will want to know

98
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:16,958
whether I'll do his homework or not

99
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,628
now that I don't need his ticket to Seoul.

100
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:44,903
Hey!

101
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,572
No!

102
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:52,869
- I haven't met Ms. Kim yet.
- Who are you?

103
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:58,917
Yoon-hyeok!

104
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,594
Right on! That was smooth.

105
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:10,804
Are you in Seoul now?

106
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,015
Yeah, I am. We're in the same office.

107
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,767
Oh, really?

108
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:16,852
What are you doing?

109
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:19,604
It's heavy.

110
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,277
Why don't you just get your own?

111
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:26,653
Why? I can just use yours.

112
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:28,113
What was that?

113
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:30,198
Why was he being so awkward?

114
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,084
Hello.

115
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:43,837
You!

116
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,255
Yes, sir.

117
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,257
I haven't said anything yet.

118
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:50,427
I won't go after Mr. Jang Tae-sik again

119
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:54,097
without definite evidence.

120
00:07:57,517 --> 00:08:00,061
Now, we're talking!

121
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,817
I'll make sure

122
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,153
to crush Mr. Jang

123
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,571
with definite evidence.

124
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,503
Give up on arresting Tae-sik?

125
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,546
There's no way.

126
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,510
INAUGURATION OF BAEK YI-SEOK
AS THE 20TH CHIEF JUDGE OF THE SEOUL COURT

127
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:32,636
Be careful.

128
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,056
- I got it.
- Hold the ladder properly.

129
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:38,808
Canceling the inauguration ceremony

130
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:40,143
for a last-minute meeting
with the presiding judges?

131
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,478
This is ridiculous.

132
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,065
He's cracking the whip from his first day
to bring the judges to heel.

133
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,441
You need to take action.

134
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:47,943
Watch your mouth.

135
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:50,695
The Judiciary is a mess.

136
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:52,822
A Chief Justice from Jeju

137
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:55,450
and a Chief Judge from the Chungnam Court?

138
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,953
What is this,
the uprising of small-town judges?

139
00:08:58,036 --> 00:08:59,913
No uprising ever leads to success, anyway.

140
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:13,593
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

141
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:28,400
Hello, everyone. I'm Baek Yi-seok.

142
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,111
The Seoul Central District Court

143
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:35,198
is currently not doing well enough
to celebrate my inauguration.

144
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:37,742
So, I canceled the ceremony.

145
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,163
The Judiciary exists for the people.

146
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,999
Therefore, our judicial authority

147
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,043
must not become a source
of privilege and power.

148
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,128
Chief Justice.

149
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:52,090
Your statement seems to suggest

150
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:55,260
that we, as judges,
use our ruling authority in court

151
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:56,636
for inappropriate purposes.

152
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:04,269
Is that wrong?

153
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:07,814
- Sorry?
- Is that not true?

154
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,372
Everyone...

155
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,294
Please be respectful to each other.

156
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,923
This is his wise counsel
in lieu of his inaugural speech.

157
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:48,480
From this day forward

158
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:52,609
there will be no judicial favoritism
for former colleagues at this court.

159
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,736
If such conduct is found

160
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:59,366
it will be considered collusion
or inappropriate preferential treatment.

161
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:08,458
Congratulations on your inauguration.

162
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,901
Shouldn't we make a plan?

163
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:39,781
He had a good point. No need for a plan.

164
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:49,165
How many presiding judges
do you think are on my side?

165
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:52,252
There are probably more judges
on Mr. Kang's side.

166
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,383
Don't you want to know

167
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:02,971
where Sin-jin's power comes from?

168
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,268
It can't just be from his position
as the Senior Presiding Judge.

169
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:10,145
I'll look into it.

170
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,442
Is Judge Lee also starting today?

171
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,526
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:21,406
I'll stop Chairman Woo Gyo-hun

173
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:24,659
using Prosecutor General Eom.

174
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:26,035
How?

175
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,704
Mr. Eom's son is

176
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:29,581
doing drugs in the States.

177
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,044
- So?
- And so is Gyo-hun's daughter.

178
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:36,463
Is she also in the States?

179
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:37,547
No, she lives in Korea.

180
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,467
She's a senior at Hancheon University.

181
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:42,302
In Korea.

182
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:45,847
Yeah, in Korea.

183
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,185
You got a real good one.

184
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,352
How's that?

185
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,979
I got a real good one, didn't I?

186
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:54,272
But you're already in Seoul

187
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:56,065
so how should I reciprocate?

188
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,233
Do you want anything?

189
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:00,069
Let me take Prosecutor General Eom.

190
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:01,863
What?

191
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,784
WOMAN SLAPPING HER DATE, WHO'S A JUDGE

192
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,122
You need to bring a gift
to marry Haenal Law Firm's daughter?

193
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:13,041
I have nothing to offer them.

194
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,043
So, I plan on making Mr. Eom

195
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,796
Haenal's legal advisor.

196
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:21,257
Okay.

197
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:24,219
That'll be my wedding gift for you.

198
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:26,387
Congratulations in advance.

199
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:27,597
Thank you, sir.

200
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:34,521
Kang Sin-jin

201
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:37,690
you're not going to a wedding.

202
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:38,942
You're going to court.

203
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:52,121
He knows exactly how to use me

204
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,541
to his advantage.

205
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,044
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

206
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,887
Why is Han-young

207
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,889
coming out of here?

208
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,894
Why?

209
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,439
Have they known each other for a while?

210
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:21,401
How am I supposed to ask Han-young
about this?

211
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:23,945
Well, what's wrong
with asking some questions?

212
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,446
Just ask him. Go ahead.

213
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,823
Call him.

214
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:28,074
Oh, gosh.

215
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:29,534
BAEK YI-SEOK, CHIEF JUDGE

216
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:31,703
Yes, Mr. Baek.

217
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:33,830
Right now?

218
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:36,040
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:41,880
Why does he need to see Han-young?

220
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:45,967
Maybe he already knows about it.

221
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:48,678
Judge Lee.

222
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:51,306
Yes, Mr. Baek.

223
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:54,851
Take the Nammyeon District sinkhole case.

224
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:56,769
Sorry?

225
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:58,229
Why are you surprised?

226
00:14:58,897 --> 00:14:59,898
Well, you know...

227
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:02,775
It's just that people have
so many theories

228
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,569
about what caused the sinkhole.

229
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:06,279
Don't you think it's too big a task

230
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:08,281
for Judge Lee?

231
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:10,366
The sinkhole in Nammyeon District.

232
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,243
The victims started blaming

233
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,954
the Nammyeon District Office

234
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:18,166
when the investigation started
going nowhere.

235
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,418
In particular

236
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:23,254
the casualties were the biggest issue.

237
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:25,423
The press will attack the court

238
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,884
if we only consider the technicalities

239
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:31,930
letting emotion override the law
in court is

240
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:33,139
also very risky.

241
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:35,266
Right?

242
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:37,977
He doesn't want such a tricky case.

243
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:42,732
Hey, Jeong-ho.

244
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:46,319
I think Woo Gyo-hun is mixed up
with the Nammyeon District Mayor.

245
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:49,197
Looks like Taemyeong Construction
paid them off pretty well.

246
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,866
In return for getting all projects
from Nammyeon District.

247
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,621
Leave it to me, and I'll do my best.

248
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:06,714
You brought the case onto yourself

249
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:07,882
so you'd better do well.

250
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,008
Yes, sir.

251
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,053
By the way

252
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:15,056
have you seen her since moving to Seoul?

253
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,766
- Who?
- Who else?

254
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:18,935
Where's my follow-up
after that viral first date?

255
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,061
Don't leave me hanging.

256
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:21,604
You really have no news for me?

257
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:24,107
- Don't make me look into it.
- There's nothing.

258
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,566
Anything else, then?

259
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,194
You got anything else to tell me?

260
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,613
Maybe you can look into it yourself.

261
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:33,324
Bye, then.

262
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:42,083
Man!

263
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:44,335
Ms. Yu

264
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:47,046
I'm calling you to discuss
Prosecutor General Eom.

265
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,766
The Nammyeon District sinkhole case.

266
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:04,230
The truth behind the sinkhole was revealed
only after a change in administration.

267
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:19,787
Dad said he was somewhere around here.

268
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,123
Where is he?

269
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:24,417
Maybe there?

270
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,218
Bamtol!

271
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:37,055
Ta-da!

272
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:51,027
MY ADORABLE SON MIN-GU

273
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:53,780
Hey, Min-gu.

274
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:55,031
Hey, Dad.

275
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:56,699
Where are you?

276
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:58,993
Me? Just across the street.

277
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,495
Across the street?

278
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:01,579
I don't see you.

279
00:18:01,662 --> 00:18:03,122
Do you see me waving?

280
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,166
Oh, there you are.

281
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:06,250
I'll be right over.

282
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:07,502
Okay!

283
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:14,133
- Oh, no!
- Goodness!

284
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:15,343
HAND-PULLED SUJEBI AND KALGUKSU

285
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:29,107
Sir!

286
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,318
Are you okay?

287
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,195
Min-gu!

288
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,823
- Don't go!
- Stop!

289
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,538
Bamtol!

290
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,123
Bamtol!

291
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,916
Bamtol!

292
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,836
Please help!

293
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,341
Min-gu!

294
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:13,317
Take anything that can be used
as evidence.

295
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:14,735
Major Chu Yong-jin of Nammyeon District

296
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:17,280
was the head of the Obok gang

297
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:21,784
and the head of Taemyeon Construction was
the gang's enforcer.

298
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:26,247
The investigation revealed

299
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,293
that the sinkhole was caused
by faulty water and sewer construction.

300
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:32,837
But

301
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,964
in the trial regarding the casualties

302
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:37,383
the Nammyeon District Office won
in appeal, too

303
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:40,553
and the Supreme Court dismissed
the appeal of the bereaved families.

304
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:43,681
MAYOR CHU MUST SPEAK
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE SINKHOLE

305
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,020
We demand an apology from Mayor Chu!

306
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:51,272
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

307
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:53,274
Nammyeon District Office,
take accountability!

308
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,443
- Take accountability!
- Take accountability!

309
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:57,528
We demand an apology from Mayor Chu!

310
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,906
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

311
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:01,574
Let's take a break.

312
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:05,494
You must be exhausted.

313
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:06,746
Have some water.

314
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,706
You must be exhausted.

315
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,166
Have some water.

316
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:14,587
Have some...

317
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:21,886
Wow.

318
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,888
Where was this?

319
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:27,350
I'm guessing this is from a trip
with your son.

320
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:32,605
I'm

321
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,529
Song Na-yeon,
a reporter with Daejin Daily.

322
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:42,198
I'm not interested.

323
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,291
Okay.

324
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,669
Okay, see you later.

325
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:56,629
Bye.

326
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:02,885
Why did Mr. Lim want to see you?

327
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:06,389
Mr. Baek assigned me to a case.

328
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,724
- Which case?
- The Nammyeon District sinkhole case.

329
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:14,981
Damn, everyone's already talking
about how messy it is.

330
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,443
He's too harsh on you.
You literally just moved here.

331
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:20,569
I know.

332
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:28,953
What is she doing here?

333
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:36,085
Come in.

334
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:53,936
What brings you here?

335
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:56,105
I'd like to talk to him.

336
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:13,622
Oh, hey.

337
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,835
Had no idea
judge offices looked like this.

338
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:19,503
Looks ugly.

339
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:21,005
Why don't we head out?

340
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:30,181
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG
JUDGE KIM YOON-HYEOK

341
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,602
Unbelievable.

342
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,813
When did he get himself a girl?

343
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:39,148
How does he have time?

344
00:22:45,738 --> 00:22:47,448
Wait, is that Yu Se-hee from Haenal?

345
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,701
Should we sit here?

346
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:56,791
You're at the Central Court now?

347
00:22:57,124 --> 00:22:58,667
Yup, this is my first day.

348
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:01,462
If you called me to be your lunch buddy,
this is the last time.

349
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:04,215
Eating alone is trendy now.
Get used to it.

350
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:06,258
I managed to get
Sin-jin and Seon-cheol on my side

351
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:08,052
by using Gyo-hun.

352
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:10,554
But not Jang Tae-sik yet.

353
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:12,932
I went after Jang Tae-sik
as soon as I became a prosecutor.

354
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,309
Do you know Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

355
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,394
Jin-a?

356
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,146
Do you need more lunch buddies
to alternate between?

357
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,066
I'm curious about her.
I hear she's principled.

358
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:25,027
I already helped you
on Kim Sang-jin's case for losing the bet.

359
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:27,238
As you know, I hate owing anyone anything.

360
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:29,615
You moved to Seoul
after busting the draft dodgers, yeah?

361
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:30,699
Yeah.

362
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,452
But don't credit yourself for it.
You only read the list.

363
00:23:33,536 --> 00:23:35,746
What? But I found that list.

364
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:37,790
Really?

365
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,172
Wait, really?

366
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,051
Are you serious?

367
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:51,470
Not letting yourself owe anyone anything

368
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:53,472
must be so tiring.

369
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,147
Ms. Kim joined the prosecution
two years after I did.

370
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,774
I found Gyo-hun's daughter.

371
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:05,609
I'll head in as soon as the club opens.

372
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:07,778
Let's all have dinner together. My treat.

373
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:34,513
Hey, everyone.

374
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:37,016
Excuse me.

375
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:40,269
Hello, there.

376
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,729
Wait, let me see your faces.

377
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:51,447
What a mess.

378
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:55,534
Who are you?

379
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,786
Hey, who are you?

380
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,913
Me?

381
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:00,289
An angel.

382
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:23,604
- Hello.
- Who are you?

383
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:24,855
A new bodyguard?

384
00:25:25,314 --> 00:25:27,233
Hey, make sure I look pretty in the photo.

385
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:29,652
I sure will.

386
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:32,404
Hold on.

387
00:25:33,072 --> 00:25:34,615
Hold this. You'll look prettier.

388
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:38,744
Stunning!

389
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:40,829
Right on. Look here.

390
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:00,808
PROSECUTOR GENERAL EOM JUN-HO

391
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:13,654
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

392
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:18,659
PROSECUTOR GENERAL EOM JUN-HO

393
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:27,418
The woman in the photo is
the daughter of Woo Gyo-hun

394
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:29,086
the Ministry of Justice candidate.

395
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:34,133
Kids don't always turn out
the way their parents want.

396
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:35,384
Whether it be

397
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:37,344
a daughter or a son.

398
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:41,015
Who are you?

399
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:53,068
Thank you for hiring me in Seoul.

400
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:55,571
I told you I'd do it soon.

401
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,701
Keep a good eye on Yi-seok here, too.

402
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:03,203
And Han-young.

403
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:06,457
Sure

404
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,751
but why Han-young, too?

405
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:11,587
Because Yi-seok brought him here.

406
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:14,214
Keeping an eye on Han-young is

407
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:16,091
an extension of keeping an eye on Yi-seok.

408
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:18,802
Yes, sir.

409
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:20,679
Oh, right.

410
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:22,848
Yu Se-hee from Haenal

411
00:27:22,931 --> 00:27:24,808
visited Han-young today.

412
00:27:25,684 --> 00:27:27,436
- Did she?
- Yes, sir.

413
00:27:27,728 --> 00:27:30,105
I hear the two might be getting married.

414
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:37,988
Good work.

415
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:42,701
Hello.

416
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:47,206
I'm Yu Se-hee,
the Team Manager at Haenal Law Firm.

417
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,214
The person you spoke to on the phone
will be here soon.

418
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:57,466
He works nearby.

419
00:27:57,966 --> 00:27:59,927
Is Seon-cheol behind this?

420
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,721
Do as I say when you meet Mr. Eom, okay?

421
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:04,932
No, my father doesn't know about this.

422
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:07,518
Your father? That means Mr. Yu is...

423
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:08,602
Yes.

424
00:28:11,438 --> 00:28:12,481
Gosh, this is heavy.

425
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:18,529
Hello.

426
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,906
I'm Judge Lee Han-young
at the Seoul Central Court.

427
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:24,660
What is a judge
from the Seoul Central Court doing

428
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:26,662
with the daughter of Haenal's Partner?

429
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:28,914
I'm sure you've seen the photos by now.

430
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:32,084
These are all the evidence collected
from the scene.

431
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:33,335
This is enough

432
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:36,171
to justify an emergency arrest
of Gyo-hun's daughter.

433
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,631
Why should I do that?

434
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:41,969
I've already told you.

435
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:44,513
Kids don't always turn out
the way their parents want.

436
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,182
Whether it be a daughter or a son.

437
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:52,813
The fact that Jun-ho is here means

438
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:55,733
he understands what's going on
with his son in Washington, DC.

439
00:28:55,983 --> 00:28:58,068
Stop with this nonsense and go home.

440
00:28:58,402 --> 00:29:00,028
Cross the line again

441
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:02,114
and you'll both pay for it.

442
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:03,866
What time is it in Washington, DC?

443
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:08,328
It's 8:40 p.m. here

444
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:10,873
so it should be 7:40 a.m. there.

445
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:15,002
Do you think the employees
at Haenal's DC office are at work now?

446
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:16,462
Of course.

447
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,338
Haenal has a branch in the US.

448
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:19,757
Do you know anyone there?

449
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:21,967
No.

450
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:25,179
But everyone there should know who I am.

451
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:26,346
That should work.

452
00:29:27,222 --> 00:29:28,640
What the hell are you doing?

453
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,977
Yes, Ms. Yu.

454
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,061
You ready?

455
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:35,856
Yes, Mr. Eom's son had a party last night

456
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:38,108
so we took videos and collected
all evidence of drug use.

457
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:39,902
Should I report him to the police now?

458
00:29:41,153 --> 00:29:42,696
ANDREW CHOI

459
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,822
Sorry.

460
00:29:56,251 --> 00:30:00,297
OFFICE FOR MINISTER OF JUSTICE
CONFIRMATION HEARING PREPARATION

461
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:06,136
It's just a confirmation hearing.

462
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,430
I just have to get through one day.

463
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:11,725
Don't worry about me, Mr. Kang.

464
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,686
Just focus on serving His Excellency.

465
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:18,148
So you can become a Justice
or even the Chief Justice

466
00:30:18,232 --> 00:30:19,274
you know?

467
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:21,360
I don't know if I have what it takes.

468
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:24,780
If it's about your humble upbringing,
don't worry about it.

469
00:30:25,864 --> 00:30:27,199
The higher you climb

470
00:30:27,282 --> 00:30:29,993
the better people will make
your story sound.

471
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,540
I heard

472
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:40,671
you grew up at a brothel in Cheongnyangni.

473
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,047
Is that true?

474
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:44,424
I'm just curious.

475
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:46,760
No, sir.

476
00:30:49,263 --> 00:30:51,807
Right. Of course not.

477
00:30:53,016 --> 00:30:55,018
I knew I didn't need to believe that.

478
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:57,604
I grew up in a high-end hostess bar.

479
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:03,318
Babe!

480
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:05,237
- Oh, gosh.
- Babe.

481
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,864
- Oh, no.
- Watch your steps.

482
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:13,912
- Promise you'll be back tomorrow, babe.
- Tomorrow?

483
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:16,623
Yeah, I'll come back.

484
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:18,584
- Be careful.
- Alright.

485
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:19,710
I'll be back tomorrow.

486
00:31:19,793 --> 00:31:21,503
Can you get home okay?

487
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,171
See you tomorrow.

488
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:25,799
- See you tomorrow, babe.
- Yeah, see you.

489
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:44,818
The food is ready.

490
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,278
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

491
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:48,405
- Thanks for the food.
- Oh, we have jeon, too.

492
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:14,264
Oh, I see!

493
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:20,228
People really don't know
what they're talking about.

494
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:25,317
A high-end hostess bar!

495
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:32,991
Let's visit one
after the confirmation hearing.

496
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,369
You can tell me all about the old times.

497
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:47,881
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

498
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:50,717
I don't know.

499
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,762
Not sure if we'll have time for that.

500
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:57,432
We can always make time.

501
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:08,652
Whoa, this is crazy!

502
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:10,278
I was on a roll!

503
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:15,200
Let's celebrate with a drink.

504
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:17,285
Next time. Gotta finish this one up.

505
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:18,370
You can go home first.

506
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:20,539
I knew you were a prick

507
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:22,249
but man, you really are a prick.

508
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,752
Why do you want
Mr. Woo's daughter arrested?

509
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:27,254
You want Haenal Law Firm, right?

510
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:28,630
What?

511
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:30,257
I'll help you

512
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:33,552
make Haenal Law Firm yours.

513
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:37,556
Ridiculous.

514
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:50,318
Prosecutor General Eom was highly regarded
by the prosecution

515
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:52,446
for resisting
the influence of powerful people.

516
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:54,573
But he had one issue.

517
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:56,783
His son.

518
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:59,953
Mr. Woo is full of flaws.

519
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:03,331
Not only does he take bribes from everyone

520
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:05,459
but he's also used his power
in the Legislation and Judiciary Committee

521
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,794
to help big companies get their way.

522
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,963
But as you know, if you bust him for that

523
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:13,175
the prosecution will be blamed
for election meddling.

524
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:16,011
But you must stop him
from becoming the Minister of Justice.

525
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:21,224
Are you also going to use my son
to attack me

526
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:24,311
if I terminate my contract
as the legal advisor?

527
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:28,106
I know this is a dirty way
of going about it.

528
00:34:28,774 --> 00:34:31,610
But I'll make sure you never get hurt.

529
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:35,822
How can you call yourself a judge
and do stuff like this?

530
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:38,408
You know a judge shouldn't do this.

531
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:40,702
Please remember

532
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:42,954
judges exist outside of the court, too.

533
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:54,424
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

534
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:56,635
Who made you this stubborn?

535
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,971
- Gosh.
- I'm home.

536
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:01,598
Hey, Han-young.

537
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:02,682
- Hey.
- Hello.

538
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:06,019
There you are, Your Honor!

539
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:09,606
What are you doing? Say hello.

540
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:11,483
He's a judge.

541
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:14,903
Hello.

542
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,825
Hey.

543
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:24,037
I'm sorry, Grandma.

544
00:35:24,996 --> 00:35:27,124
I've caused you so much trouble.

545
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:31,419
My baby!

546
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:37,884
Do you know me?

547
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:39,136
Not at all.

548
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:42,264
Don't talk like that to His Honor!
That's rude.

549
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:43,682
I didn't say anything bad.

550
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:45,642
I'm leaving.

551
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,147
Where do you think you're going?

552
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,481
It's perfect.

553
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,233
Now that His Honor is here, too

554
00:35:53,316 --> 00:35:56,570
let's ask him to make
a righteous judgment.

555
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:00,532
Your Honor

556
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:01,616
Yes.

557
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,870
she's in ninth grade this year

558
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:07,289
but she wants to get a part-time job.

559
00:36:07,372 --> 00:36:09,040
Does that sound acceptable to you?

560
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:11,585
Students should focus on their studies!

561
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:14,629
I can't even afford to get her tutors
like everyone else

562
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:17,632
so how can I let her work?

563
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:20,927
Yeah, you should be focused on studying
in ninth grade.

564
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:22,512
- That's right.
- Indeed.

565
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:24,806
Is it acceptable
for a woman in her seventies

566
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,434
to collect scraps to raise
her granddaughter, then?

567
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:30,854
"He who does not work,
neither shall he eat." You know it.

568
00:36:31,062 --> 00:36:33,773
You have a great point there.

569
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:36,359
Who said all that nonsense?

570
00:36:36,443 --> 00:36:41,114
Your Honor, come on. I'm right, aren't I?

571
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:45,160
No! You're turning me
into a bad granddaughter here.

572
00:36:45,243 --> 00:36:47,037
Cut it out!

573
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,249
Your Honor, please do something
about my granddaughter.

574
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,668
Your Honor, please stop my grandma!

575
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,924
Okay, you two.

576
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:02,344
You'll do exactly as I tell you, right?

577
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:04,179
You'll only work for four hours per day

578
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:06,306
twice after school
and twice over the weekend.

579
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:07,390
Got it?

580
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,476
And this convenience store owner

581
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,019
knows a tutoring school

582
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:13,063
which you'll attend
on the other three days.

583
00:37:13,146 --> 00:37:15,523
You'll pay for these classes

584
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:17,317
with the money you earn from working.

585
00:37:17,692 --> 00:37:20,779
That way, you can work, study,
and help Grandma.

586
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:22,155
Perfect, right?

587
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:26,034
Right?

588
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:27,911
Fine.

589
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,123
That's still too much.
How about two hours a day...

590
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:33,208
Grandma!

591
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:36,127
I'm not deaf!

592
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:37,295
I'm hungry.

593
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:40,006
You look like you'll eat me
if I wait any longer.

594
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:42,050
Let's go.

595
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:47,347
Alright, then.

596
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:50,100
Please be a good boss to her.

597
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:52,185
Don't worry.

598
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:54,145
Get home safely.

599
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:56,731
- Goodnight!
- Bye!

600
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:07,867
I know that girl.

601
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:11,288
She visits my store every few days

602
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:14,708
and takes
all the expired samgak gimbap and milk.

603
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:19,296
I've always wanted to give her more
but couldn't

604
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:21,881
because I didn't want to offend her.

605
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:25,343
But you came to the rescue and helped her

606
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:27,971
in a way I never could.

607
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:33,101
- You crying?
- I need a drink.

608
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:36,646
Mr and Mrs. Lee, I'm leaving!

609
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,857
- Sure, good work today.
- Okay.

610
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,150
Get home safe!

611
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:47,866
A poet who died before 30 once said

612
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:51,536
he'd kept looking for what he'd lost

613
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:54,039
without knowing what he'd lost and where.

614
00:38:55,957 --> 00:38:57,667
But I know

615
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:00,420
what I'd lost

616
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:04,132
in my previous life.

617
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:10,930
Na-yeong, dinnertime.

618
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:12,807
You said you were hungry.

619
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:13,975
Okay.

620
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:20,940
Grandma, can I have some milk?

621
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:22,901
But we're having dinner now.

622
00:39:22,984 --> 00:39:23,985
I want it now.

623
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:26,488
My gosh.

624
00:39:31,117 --> 00:39:32,118
Here you go.

625
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:33,370
You know how I bring

626
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:35,205
expired samgak gimbap and milk

627
00:39:35,288 --> 00:39:37,499
- from the convenience store?
- Yeah.

628
00:39:37,582 --> 00:39:39,000
The store owner you just met

629
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:42,295
always slips in a few things
that aren't expired.

630
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:43,546
Really?

631
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,590
See? This isn't expired, either.

632
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:47,258
Oh, my.

633
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:50,762
But I play along.

634
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:51,846
Why?

635
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,432
You should thank him.

636
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:57,310
I just feel
like that's the right thing to do.

637
00:39:58,353 --> 00:39:59,646
You don't need to know why.

638
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:04,526
Han-young

639
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:09,823
remember how my mom ran a fish shop
at the market when I was a kid?

640
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:11,449
Go home. You're drunk.

641
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,368
Hey, hey!

642
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:15,078
I'm not drunk.

643
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:17,497
You always talk about the fish shop
when you're drunk.

644
00:40:17,872 --> 00:40:19,374
I just feel bad.

645
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:23,211
I feel like I owe Mom an apology.

646
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:26,214
She was just a young lady, too.

647
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:30,343
She couldn't have enjoyed
handling fish all day.

648
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:34,305
But I always threw the money she gave me

649
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:37,559
saying her money reeked
of that fishy smell.

650
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:39,936
What a little brat.

651
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:41,771
I don't deserve to be called her son.

652
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:50,864
Han-young

653
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:55,243
if I could turn back time

654
00:40:57,537 --> 00:40:59,998
I'd go back to then
and handle all the fish myself.

655
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,084
I'd tell Mom

656
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:06,129
to wear all the makeup she wants

657
00:41:06,504 --> 00:41:08,006
and only work as a cashier.

658
00:41:09,924 --> 00:41:13,136
You got her makeup for her birthday,
remember?

659
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:17,390
You know

660
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:24,522
that was because all the other moms
smelled good.

661
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:27,650
That was why.

662
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:30,904
I wanted her to stop smelling like fish.

663
00:41:32,614 --> 00:41:33,615
Hey

664
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:38,077
but the kids were so kind
not to tease me, huh?

665
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:40,914
No, they just didn't want to get
their asses kicked.

666
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,711
They covered their noses and teased you
when you weren't around.

667
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:48,588
I know!

668
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:54,010
But you didn't.

669
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:57,096
Because

670
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:02,018
I liked fish.

671
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:10,527
Han-young

672
00:42:18,618 --> 00:42:19,702
I'm so glad

673
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:25,208
that such a good man has become a judge.

674
00:42:28,336 --> 00:42:29,420
I'm so glad.

675
00:42:32,465 --> 00:42:34,342
What a relief.

676
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:36,302
It sure is.

677
00:42:40,473 --> 00:42:41,641
What a relief...

678
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:53,987
No, Jeong-ho.

679
00:42:54,654 --> 00:42:56,239
I was a terrible judge.

680
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:58,074
The 25-year-old lady with leukemia waited

681
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:00,994
for the law to save her
from her workplace injury.

682
00:43:01,077 --> 00:43:03,663
However, the court ruled
her proof to be insufficient

683
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:05,665
excusing the corporate
of responsibilities.

684
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:07,458
That afternoon

685
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,168
the woman jumped
from her hospital building.

686
00:43:09,252 --> 00:43:10,795
The court hereby orders
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

687
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:14,007
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

688
00:43:21,014 --> 00:43:22,765
You know it too, Jeong-ho.

689
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:27,186
That I'm a total scumbag

690
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:29,480
who abandoned his father, twice.

691
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:56,049
EOM JUN-HO

692
00:43:56,132 --> 00:43:57,133
What?

693
00:43:57,216 --> 00:44:00,511
You blackmailed the Prosecutor General
using his drug addict son?

694
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,223
I'll help you make Haenal Law Firm yours.

695
00:44:04,724 --> 00:44:07,810
And you know,
I don't even smoke cigarettes.

696
00:44:09,562 --> 00:44:10,563
Good girl.

697
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:12,940
You're the best daughter ever.

698
00:44:18,196 --> 00:44:21,449
Did I just choose the perfect son-in-law

699
00:44:22,784 --> 00:44:25,119
or bring myself future trouble?

700
00:44:26,412 --> 00:44:28,498
You're so strong for being back again.

701
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:33,044
You're not holding
photos of your son today?

702
00:44:33,127 --> 00:44:35,088
His tablet PC ran out of battery.

703
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:37,674
There's nowhere to charge it
because we're outside.

704
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:45,515
Here.

705
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:53,773
Wow.

706
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:55,233
Where was this?

707
00:44:56,526 --> 00:44:58,152
This was when he was in sixth grade.

708
00:44:59,487 --> 00:45:00,988
We were hiking the Jiri Mountain.

709
00:45:05,743 --> 00:45:08,037
PLEASE HELP ME GET MY LOST SON BACK

710
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:15,586
Sir

711
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:18,464
I'm here

712
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:22,051
to help you.

713
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:26,305
Sorry about yesterday.

714
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:30,226
I thought
you were from the District Office.

715
00:45:31,102 --> 00:45:32,103
No, right?

716
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:34,772
Oh, not at all.

717
00:45:39,193 --> 00:45:40,319
Stop here.

718
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:45,992
WE DEMAND AN APOLOGY FROM MAYOR CHU

719
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:49,537
Why are they always pestering us here?

720
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:56,085
She doesn't look like one of them.

721
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:58,504
She looks like a news reporter.

722
00:45:59,422 --> 00:46:01,966
Aren't there
more important stories to cover?

723
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:05,762
It's Chu Yong-jin!

724
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:07,305
Mayor!

725
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:08,765
Hey!

726
00:46:19,817 --> 00:46:21,152
Hey, call Haenal.

727
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,033
Here you go, sir.

728
00:46:27,575 --> 00:46:28,576
Okay.

729
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:31,746
Hello?

730
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:33,039
Hey

731
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:35,792
what are you going to do
about those pests outside?

732
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:38,628
I thought Haenal was
the best firm in the nation.

733
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:41,047
Do I need to hire the world's best now?

734
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,508
There's a delay in the settlement
with the bereaved families.

735
00:46:43,966 --> 00:46:45,051
Please be patient...

736
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:47,470
Had it not been for Congressman Kang
introducing you to me

737
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:49,472
I would've sorted this out myself already.

738
00:46:50,097 --> 00:46:52,183
You can keep what I've paid you

739
00:46:52,266 --> 00:46:53,726
but you're off this case!

740
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,314
What the hell was that?

741
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:12,370
Hey.

742
00:47:12,787 --> 00:47:15,039
Hurry and deal with the guys
who died in the sinkhole first.

743
00:47:15,122 --> 00:47:16,707
- Get on it.
- Yes, sir.

744
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:30,721
What the hell did you do to the sewers
to cause a sinkhole like that?

745
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:32,223
Seriously!

746
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:34,892
Did you file paperwork
without doing the actual construction?

747
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:37,520
You crazy idiot!

748
00:47:37,603 --> 00:47:39,647
Burn all records!

749
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:46,279
TAEMYEONG

750
00:47:47,446 --> 00:47:49,532
It's too hot for this bullshit.

751
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:52,326
PROJECT OUTLINE FOR SEWER MAINTENANCE WORK
IN NAMMYEON DISTRICT

752
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,412
We demand an apology from Mayor Chu!

753
00:47:54,495 --> 00:47:56,706
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

754
00:47:56,789 --> 00:47:58,708
Nammyeon District Office,
take accountability!

755
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:00,793
- Take accountability!
- Take accountability!

756
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,421
Mr. Lee, I hear you work in Seoul now.

757
00:48:05,172 --> 00:48:07,717
Are you still "Six and Done,"
even at your new job?

758
00:48:10,177 --> 00:48:12,847
Do you want to see me after work, then?

759
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,140
Is something wrong?

760
00:48:15,016 --> 00:48:17,101
It's about the sinkhole
in Nammyeon District.

761
00:48:17,977 --> 00:48:20,187
Hear me out later.

762
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:22,690
Oh, sure. See you after work.

763
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,614
What does Ms. Song have to do
with the sinkhole case?

764
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:36,329
The public won't receive it well
if you step up to speak.

765
00:48:37,788 --> 00:48:40,541
Don't you already see
the public hating on me?

766
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:43,544
Didn't you see the protesters outside?

767
00:48:45,087 --> 00:48:46,714
It's not easy to reach a settlement.

768
00:48:46,797 --> 00:48:49,133
You should focus on the trial instead.

769
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,220
And what? Let the case drag on in court

770
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:55,306
without even a settlement?

771
00:48:59,352 --> 00:49:01,228
I'll work on the settlement.

772
00:49:02,313 --> 00:49:03,314
Maybe you can help me

773
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:05,650
by being my golf buddy?

774
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,530
I did some research after hearing
some questionable things about Mayor Chu

775
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:13,699
and he's a part of the Obok gang.

776
00:49:14,325 --> 00:49:17,411
Nammyeon District's representative is
Kang Jeong-tae in the majority party

777
00:49:17,495 --> 00:49:19,455
and Chu helped Kang
since his first term in office

778
00:49:19,538 --> 00:49:21,707
eventually being nominated
as the District Mayor.

779
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:25,419
He better not force a settlement
using violence.

780
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:31,926
Any updates?

781
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:36,097
Judge Lee Han-young is taking the case?

782
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,976
Okay, got it.

783
00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:46,857
Next.

784
00:49:49,944 --> 00:49:50,945
Next.

785
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:53,531
Next.

786
00:49:53,864 --> 00:49:56,659
Next!

787
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,662
Let's celebrate with a drink.

788
00:49:59,745 --> 00:50:01,372
Next time. Gotta finish this one up.

789
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:03,290
So, when's the next time?

790
00:50:06,127 --> 00:50:08,087
Why isn't he calling me
about that next time?

791
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:18,556
Of course.

792
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:20,016
He can't resist me.

793
00:50:21,434 --> 00:50:22,810
Damn it.

794
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:24,770
What a damn prick.

795
00:50:26,564 --> 00:50:27,732
PRICK

796
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:30,109
What?

797
00:50:30,192 --> 00:50:31,193
Hey, my Se-hee.

798
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:33,237
You sound upset. Are you shopping?

799
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,321
You want to fight me?

800
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:37,074
Judge Lee is taking
the Nammyeon District sinkhole case.

801
00:50:37,158 --> 00:50:39,326
Shouldn't your new beau
try to impress me, too?

802
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,120
I could become his future sister-in-law.

803
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:43,956
Who says you'll become his sister-in-law?

804
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,249
Is it so hard

805
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:47,501
to tell him
that Haenal is representing this case?

806
00:50:47,585 --> 00:50:49,336
He's on the case. Why wouldn't he know?

807
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,548
Still, it's different when you tell him.

808
00:50:54,383 --> 00:50:55,509
I'll give you

809
00:50:56,594 --> 00:50:57,720
my D. Mario purse.

810
00:50:58,512 --> 00:51:01,098
It's a limited edition.
You can't buy it with money alone.

811
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:03,350
I don't know.

812
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:05,144
Let me think about it.

813
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,150
Hey!

814
00:51:12,193 --> 00:51:13,194
My gosh.

815
00:51:13,486 --> 00:51:15,321
You've been real busy

816
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:16,781
since moving to Seoul, huh?

817
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:19,867
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

818
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,289
You seem full of worries.

819
00:51:25,372 --> 00:51:26,540
And who's causing them all?

820
00:51:26,624 --> 00:51:29,376
I told you to stop arguing with your wife.
Let her win.

821
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,629
Why keep arguing when you can't even win?

822
00:51:31,712 --> 00:51:34,381
Just go with whatever keeps the peace,
okay?

823
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:37,259
I'm not losing. I'm letting her win.

824
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:40,304
See you tomorrow, then.

825
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:44,016
Seriously.

826
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:45,267
Huh?

827
00:51:45,476 --> 00:51:46,602
What a coincidence.

828
00:51:47,812 --> 00:51:49,396
What brings you here?

829
00:51:50,064 --> 00:51:52,024
You don't think I've come all the way

830
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,192
to see you, right?

831
00:51:53,275 --> 00:51:54,401
Oh!

832
00:51:54,485 --> 00:51:56,278
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

833
00:51:56,362 --> 00:51:59,198
We said we'd meet next time, anyway.

834
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:00,825
Yeah, see you next time, then.

835
00:52:01,826 --> 00:52:03,202
When next time?

836
00:52:03,744 --> 00:52:05,246
When's that next time?

837
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:07,998
Why are you always in such a rush?

838
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:09,333
Are you busy tonight?

839
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,418
If you are, change your plans.

840
00:52:11,502 --> 00:52:12,878
Have dinner with me instead.

841
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:14,421
Let's go. It's on me.

842
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:18,300
Mr. Lee!

843
00:52:19,593 --> 00:52:21,720
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic on the way.

844
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:23,806
Oh, it's dinnertime.

845
00:52:23,889 --> 00:52:26,642
I'm starving. Can we talk over dinner?

846
00:52:29,728 --> 00:52:32,731
Excuse me, I got here first.

847
00:52:33,607 --> 00:52:36,443
Oh, did you have dinner plans already?

848
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:37,528
No.

849
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:43,909
I heard you were taking
Nammyeon District's case.

850
00:52:43,993 --> 00:52:46,495
Wow, you're definitely from Haenal.

851
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:47,621
You're quick.

852
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:50,332
Haenal Law Firm?

853
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:53,669
We're defending Nammyeon District Office.

854
00:52:53,752 --> 00:52:55,754
Let's go. We should talk.

855
00:52:58,424 --> 00:52:59,425
Hold on.

856
00:53:00,301 --> 00:53:01,886
Get lost!

857
00:53:01,969 --> 00:53:03,637
Don't you guys have parents?

858
00:53:05,598 --> 00:53:07,141
Hey, this is precious.

859
00:53:07,224 --> 00:53:09,059
Don't forget to pick up every bill.

860
00:53:09,643 --> 00:53:10,811
Damn you!

861
00:53:11,103 --> 00:53:12,479
No, I don't have parents.

862
00:53:12,563 --> 00:53:15,065
And I didn't get married.
I didn't want kids like me.

863
00:53:17,985 --> 00:53:19,486
Look at that.

864
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:21,614
What a handsome kid.

865
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:24,074
You know,
people kill their parents for money.

866
00:53:24,158 --> 00:53:25,618
But you don't need to worry now.

867
00:53:25,993 --> 00:53:28,245
Just think of your son's passing
as bad luck

868
00:53:28,495 --> 00:53:29,496
and settle.

869
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:31,498
How can you call yourself human?

870
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:34,210
You need to apologize
for what you've done!

871
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:35,502
Of course, I'm human.

872
00:53:35,586 --> 00:53:37,254
I have eyes, nose

873
00:53:37,713 --> 00:53:38,756
and lips.

874
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:40,382
Wow

875
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:42,176
your kid was smart, huh?

876
00:53:43,177 --> 00:53:46,138
You know, even with a college degree

877
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,848
kids these days can't find a job.

878
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:49,683
That's so burdensome for their parents

879
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:53,896
so it's good that yours died.

880
00:53:59,026 --> 00:54:00,361
Shut up!

881
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:02,321
Honey!

882
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:05,532
What a joke.

883
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,118
You're holding the knife wrong.

884
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:10,246
Can you even stab me?

885
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:12,790
Go ahead.

886
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,291
Honey!

887
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:16,377
Stab me.

888
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:19,505
Go right ahead.

889
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,881
Go ahead!

890
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,174
Stab me!

891
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:23,342
Get out!

892
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,485
Are you really taking
the Nammyeon District trial?

893
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:43,279
- Yeah.
- What?

894
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:49,201
Why is that such an easy decision for you?

895
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:51,537
Can't believe I expected better from you!

896
00:54:52,454 --> 00:54:53,497
What's going on?

897
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,210
You two are in bed together.

898
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,546
It's over
when a judge joins hands with a law firm.

899
00:55:06,844 --> 00:55:07,886
Yes, hello?

900
00:55:08,595 --> 00:55:10,431
Ms. Song, please help me.

901
00:55:10,514 --> 00:55:11,890
Okay.

902
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:13,600
I'll be right over.

903
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:18,981
I thought you were better.

904
00:55:19,857 --> 00:55:21,692
Didn't you come to tell me something?

905
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:24,361
You two...

906
00:55:27,114 --> 00:55:28,198
Forget it.

907
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,205
Did your sister send you here?

908
00:55:36,707 --> 00:55:38,709
You must be quite interested in Haenal.

909
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:40,586
Tell Ms. Yu that the talk went well.

910
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:42,838
Does that mean you're teaming up with us?

911
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:43,922
Nope.

912
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:45,174
Come on.

913
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:46,759
What's your plan, then?

914
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:47,926
The trial will lead

915
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,137
to Mayor Chu and Assemblyman Kang

916
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,221
to be arrested.

917
00:55:51,305 --> 00:55:53,932
So, tell your sister what I just said

918
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:55,476
and stay out of this.

919
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,438
Stay out...

920
00:56:02,274 --> 00:56:05,486
What was that?
Why is he talking like we're friends?

921
00:56:09,573 --> 00:56:10,574
Whatever.

922
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,327
I did my part and told him.

923
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:18,332
ATTORNEY YU HA-NA

924
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:24,421
I told Judge Lee about the case.

925
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,176
Okay.

926
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,554
Ms. Song!

927
00:56:33,847 --> 00:56:35,349
Where are you going?

928
00:56:35,432 --> 00:56:37,101
I'm visiting the house of the parents

929
00:56:37,184 --> 00:56:38,977
who lost their son to the sinkhole.

930
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:41,939
The District Mayor is now threatening them
for a settlement.

931
00:56:42,022 --> 00:56:44,233
How much have you looked into Mayor Chu?

932
00:56:44,316 --> 00:56:45,776
A whole lot.

933
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:49,363
Up to how corrupt he is, making deals
with a bogus construction company.

934
00:56:50,364 --> 00:56:51,532
But that's not all.

935
00:56:51,615 --> 00:56:53,951
Mayor Chu is associated with a gang.

936
00:56:55,285 --> 00:56:57,287
- What?
- Be careful.

937
00:57:00,082 --> 00:57:01,667
Mind your own business.

938
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:11,677
Seriously, be careful.

939
00:57:14,805 --> 00:57:16,723
Whatever.

940
00:57:24,314 --> 00:57:26,358
I remember a reporter getting beaten

941
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:28,068
when she visited a bereaved family.

942
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:33,824
Should I have stopped her from going?

943
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,869
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

944
00:57:36,952 --> 00:57:39,580
Why is he calling?
He's on Haenal's side, anyway.

945
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,377
The call cannot be completed.
You will be taken...

946
00:57:45,544 --> 00:57:47,004
CALL HISTORY

947
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:48,630
STONE JEONG-HO

948
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:55,888
Let's get it started.

949
00:57:57,222 --> 00:57:59,266
Okay, I'm on my way.

950
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:00,976
Get them to sign
the agreement before I arrive.

951
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:02,686
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

952
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,774
Let's settle on your son's case

953
00:58:08,066 --> 00:58:09,359
and my torn forehead at once.

954
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:11,820
Hey

955
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:15,532
you've never been in jail, have you?
It's tough in there.

956
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,701
Just hurry...

957
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:31,006
Who are you?

958
00:58:31,673 --> 00:58:32,799
That's dangerous.

959
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,095
Me? The hand of justice!

960
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:42,476
Goodnight.

961
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:46,021
Hello.

962
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:56,615
Excuse me.

963
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:57,699
Oh, hello.

964
00:58:57,783 --> 00:58:59,284
Hello.

965
00:59:00,202 --> 00:59:02,287
Is Mr. Heo Dong-gi here?

966
00:59:03,038 --> 00:59:04,248
Oh

967
00:59:04,331 --> 00:59:07,292
he had to go somewhere.

968
00:59:11,964 --> 00:59:15,133
What happened here?

969
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:16,760
It's nothing.

970
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:26,723
Stop right there!

971
01:01:26,807 --> 01:01:28,809
Hey! Stop!

972
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:36,274
Stop!

973
01:01:40,153 --> 01:01:41,238
No!

974
01:02:02,217 --> 01:02:03,218
Goodbye.

975
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:49,431
I'm the District Mayor
of the Nammyeon District!

976
01:02:50,307 --> 01:02:53,685
There seems to be a misunderstanding!

977
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:55,687
Just spare my life

978
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:59,191
and I'll become a new man...

979
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:01,860
Please don't kill me.

980
01:03:06,698 --> 01:03:07,824
Please!

981
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,627
HAN-YOUNG

982
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,545
When someone dies in an accident

983
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:23,924
someone must take accountability
and apologize.

984
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:25,634
My son isn't dirt

985
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:29,095
rolling around on the ground.

986
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:30,972
Whatever you choose

987
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:33,892
you won't need to be responsible
for anything, Mr. Heo.

988
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:38,980
Do you see me waving?

989
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:42,275
Oh, there you are. I'll be right over.

990
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:43,568
Okay!

991
01:03:51,034 --> 01:03:53,036
I want him to die.

992
01:03:55,413 --> 01:03:56,581
What did you say?

993
01:03:56,665 --> 01:03:58,917
I can't hear you. Louder!

994
01:03:59,584 --> 01:04:00,752
I want him

995
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:04,005
to die.

996
01:04:05,298 --> 01:04:06,633
Kill him.

997
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,677
Kill him!

998
01:04:10,804 --> 01:04:12,055
I can finally hear you.

999
01:04:30,156 --> 01:04:31,241
No!

1000
01:04:34,786 --> 01:04:36,413
Help!

1001
01:04:48,466 --> 01:04:49,843
Defendant Chu Yong-jin

1002
01:04:51,136 --> 01:04:52,888
the court hereby sentences you to death.

1003
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:08,403
No!

1004
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,367
THE JUDGE RETURNS

1005
01:05:38,558 --> 01:05:41,645
Still no movement
from Prosecutor General Eom.

1006
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:43,730
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a
from the Central District Office.

1007
01:05:43,813 --> 01:05:45,190
She won't hesitate.

1008
01:05:45,273 --> 01:05:47,192
Judge Lee requested
the prosecution to investigate.

1009
01:05:47,275 --> 01:05:48,526
We've met before.

1010
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,028
This isn't a coincidence, is it?

1011
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:51,821
It's Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo

1012
01:05:51,905 --> 01:05:53,865
who helped catch
a serial killer with Judge Lee.

1013
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:56,701
Contact Kang Jeong-tae to cut off
all ties with Chu Yong-jin.

1014
01:05:56,785 --> 01:05:57,953
And erase all traces.

1015
01:05:58,036 --> 01:06:00,163
What are you going to do
with Judge Lee Han-young?

1016
01:06:00,288 --> 01:06:02,207
You've lived
in a redevelopment zone, right?

1017
01:06:02,374 --> 01:06:04,584
There could have been an accident.

1018
01:06:04,668 --> 01:06:06,586
Kang Sin-jin knows about what happened.

1019
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:11,967
