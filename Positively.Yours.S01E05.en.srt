[This drama is fictional and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

2
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,433
[Production guidelines were followed
when filming children and animals.]

3
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:43,943
I even wonder why

4
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,233
[Episode 5]
I'm talking about this right now.

5
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:49,633
It's just that I want you to feel a bit
at ease, at least for today.

6
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,733
Does this mean

7
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:57,167
I'm falling for you?

8
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,600
- I mean...
- Wait a minute.

9
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,800
Sorry, but you should go first.

10
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,700
Can I have a word with you?

11
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,100
- That's not it.
- Not what, exactly?

12
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,533
You're not doing this because you like me.

13
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:51,000
It's just because you saw my mom's text

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,233
and felt bad for me.

15
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,700
Do you start liking someone
just because you pity them?

16
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,400
I don't.

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,367
I wasn't sure how to define this
until I said it out loud,

18
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,633
but now I'm sure.

19
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:07,200
To be precise, it's because I like you.

20
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,900
President, I...

21
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,900
I mean, I just...

22
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,667
I don't think this will work.

23
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:22,567
I'll pretend I didn't hear any of this.

24
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,600
No...

25
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:45,000
Right, he's the President.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,067
Born into wealth.

27
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,233
If I got involved, I'd only get hurt.

28
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,700
And that would be the best-case scenario.

29
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,667
My Yeol Mu...

30
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,600
Yeah.

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,967
I did the right thing. I did good.

32
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,733
Does this mean I'm falling for you?

33
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,300
To be precise, it's because I like you.

34
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,800
Ah, it drives me crazy.

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,733
Why is my heart beating so wildly?

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,733
It's okay.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,996
What have I done?

38
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:29,808
Jeez.

39
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,667
What is this, some new workout?

40
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,100
Does that help clear your head?

41
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,533
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

42
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,133
Sorry.

43
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:41,733
Anyone would think you
just confessed and got rejected.

44
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,033
Is it true?

45
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,533
Hui Won said she doesn't like you?

46
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,333
I don't know.

47
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,733
How am I supposed to face her at work now?

48
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:52,767
Why couldn't you?

49
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,600
The rejecter should feel awkward.
The rejected should be proud.

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,733
Is being honest about your feelings a crime?

51
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:01,000
Square your shoulders! Engage your core!

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,700
Down.

53
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,067
- What's wrong?
- Wait, I've got a cramp! A cramp!

54
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:10,233
That hurts!

55
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,333
Ouch, it hurts.

56
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,367
Hold on, I've got a cramp too.

57
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,333
Yes, I understand.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,733
Then text me right away.

59
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,467
I'll check my schedule and get back to you.

60
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,300
Okay.

61
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:31,533
My life got completely ruined because of you.

62
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,367
You should never have been born.

63
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:43,300
Why didn't you contact me?

64
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,367
That day, I...

65
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,700
How shameless of me.

66
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,933
After saying those things, I...

67
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,833
Why is this so hard on us?

68
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,200
How can I face him from now on?

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,433
Being honest isn't a crime.

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,500
Where did she pop up from all of a sudden?

71
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,333
Where did she go?

72
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:23,400
Wait, we don't need to make things awkward.

73
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,033
Last time, targeting campers,

74
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,267
we briefly ran a pairing promotion

75
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:50,300
where people could enjoy our Taehan Beer
alongside various camping events.

76
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,300
The results showed good response
and decent sales performance.

77
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,567
Given the recent increase
in camping enthusiasts,

78
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:01,467
for Taehan beer to position itself
as the best beer for camping,

79
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:04,033
we believe these initiatives
need to be long-term

80
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:07,900
and substantive, not just one-off events.

81
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,567
That's why we...

82
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:19,733
Are you avoiding me?

83
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,233
- Me?
- Am I making you uncomfortable?

84
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,933
Oh, not at all.

85
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,100
It's a misunderstanding, really.

86
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,867
Misunderstanding?

87
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:30,433
If there's nothing else, I've got work to do.

88
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:37,367
She's avoiding me.

89
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,000
Why do we keep running into
each other? This is awkward.

90
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:58,533
Jang Hui Won, why didn't you
answer your phone?

91
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:10,733
What happened yesterday?

92
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,476
I told you to text me when you
got home, but no response.

93
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:13,600
Jeez.

94
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm the one who turned him down,
yet I seem more bothered by it.

95
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,533
Are you listening?

96
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,067
Yeah.

97
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,400
I'm asking what happened.

98
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,133
Are you two dating?

99
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,733
No, no, it's not like that.

100
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,700
If it wasn't that, then
what did you say to him?

101
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,400
Honestly, I regretted it the whole way home.

102
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,200
I shouldn't have stepped aside.

103
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,900
Why?

104
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:50,567
Well...

105
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,567
You must've been really embarrassed.

106
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,333
I mean,

107
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,367
he came at you so recklessly,

108
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,067
right in front of me...

109
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,567
You're the type to get startled

110
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,900
and run away when someone suddenly pushes in.

111
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,833
So, it bothered me that I couldn't step in

112
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,908
and protect you.

113
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:08,800
Oh.

114
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,867
I thought...

115
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:12,500
Protect me from what? We're friends.

116
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,967
My sleepiness is gone. Need to go back.

117
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:16,700
Thanks for the drink.

118
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,167
This is driving me crazy.

119
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,900
Weren't you close with Reporter Park?

120
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,833
He pulled that postpartum care center
no-alcohol article immediately last time.

121
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,933
It's not easy being the target
of everyone's anger.

122
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,533
A reporter needs to have persistence.

123
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,100
I had him disciplined
through the Deputy Editor.

124
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,567
Oh.

125
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,767
Good job. Well done.

126
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:03,000
Since it's come to this,
let's stir things up a bit.

127
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,267
If we damage Taehan Liquor's image,

128
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:11,100
the board will have
no choice but to step in, right?

129
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,000
- How?
- You know Oh Jin Woo, Taehan Liquor's model?

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,100
Seems he was recently scammed
big time in an investment.

131
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,400
There's no one easier to control
than someone desperate for money.

132
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,633
Slip him some cash

133
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,733
and ask him to stir up
just enough controversy...

134
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,700
How are you going to clean up
the mess after that?

135
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:33,467
Instead of money to buy his silence,
how about buying him a drink?

136
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,900
Heard he likes his drinks, right?

137
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,567
A drink?

138
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:41,033
People who like drinking often make mistakes.

139
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,300
Ah, Team Leader.

140
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes?

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,033
What's with our ace? Why the long face?

142
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,500
Like someone who just lost a big sale.

143
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
What? This is even more suspicious.

144
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,200
Tell me. My lips are sealed.

145
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,600
I know, yes, I know.

146
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:13,700
Um...

147
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,600
This isn't about me, it's about a friend.

148
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Okay.

149
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,667
So, someone confessed
to my friend's female friend

150
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:23,167
right in front of him.

151
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:27,000
Logically, as a friend,
he should be supportive,

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,067
but secretly, it seems he hopes
she'll reject the confession.

153
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,067
Hold on.

154
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,800
So, did that friend commit
some serious crime?

155
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,667
Or does he have some major flaw?

156
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,333
No, it's nothing like that.

157
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,900
No? Then the answer is simple.

158
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,467
He likes her. That female friend.

159
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,800
Pardon?

160
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,133
Are you stupid, Assistant Manager Cha?

161
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:46,033
You should've made a scene,
but why just watch?

162
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:48,700
It's always the ones who don't
even know their own feelings,

163
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,733
hiding behind friendship

164
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:52,500
and saying, 'We're friends forever!'

165
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,324
I'm getting married.

166
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:56,668
What?

167
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,567
You'll come to the wedding, right?

168
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,833
Hui Won.

[Wedding day]

170
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,933
[Kang Du Jun and Jang Hui Won]
No way.

171
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:17,933
No way.

172
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:20,200
This makes no sense.

173
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,044
No!

174
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:24,800
That's so shallow.

175
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,067
I said no!

176
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,100
Assistant Manager Cha! Assistant Manager Cha!

177
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,367
- Yes?
- Oh, dear.

178
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:32,367
It's not too late! Go after her!

179
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:36,033
Running after a bus that's already gone
will only make you sore.

180
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,236
No, this isn't about me.

181
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:41,300
Don't thank me. It's nothing.

182
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,867
I mean, I just...
I don't think this will work.

183
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,367
I'll pretend I didn't hear any of this.

184
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:57,433
If there's nothing else, I've got work to do.

185
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,833
We did upper body yesterday.
How about lower body today?

186
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,600
I noticed your core strength
was a bit weak yesterday.

187
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,300
Your shoulders seem a bit slumped too.

188
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,433
I'll stick with you one-on-one
and coach you properly.

189
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:13,000
Forget it. I'll just rest today.
Not in the mood.

190
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,167
I see it now. There is a reason
your shoulders are slumped.

191
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,567
What is it this time?

192
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,267
Tell me everything.

193
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,467
Wasn't it you who told me
to stand tall and be confident?

194
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,933
What's the point of being confident

195
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,300
if she won't even face me?

196
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,600
Is Hui Won avoiding you?

197
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:31,500
On second thought, I'd feel pressured too.

198
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,867
I mean, it's not just a coworker,

199
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,367
it's the President confessing his feelings.

200
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,100
Who would just accept that so easily?

201
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,267
Maybe in dramas.

202
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:42,633
Is that so?

203
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,233
Was I only thinking about my own feelings?

204
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:46,700
Emotions don't work the way we want them to.

205
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,500
Still, in times like this, honesty is best.

206
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,067
What if I'm honest and she avoids me again?

207
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:54,333
Ah, come on.

208
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,800
Sitting here worrying
won't solve anything, you know?

209
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
You've got something you're good at.

210
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,500
Just...

211
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,000
Go for it head-on.

212
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,167
You startled me.

213
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Where are you going?

214
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,932
You don't need to know.

215
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:17,487
You...

216
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,800
He's surprisingly good
at listening to others.

217
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:35,067
May I have a word?

218
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,867
This doesn't seem like a misunderstanding.

219
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,600
It is a misunderstanding. Got proof?

220
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,267
The fact you're asking
for proof tells me everything.

221
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:51,667
This won't do.

222
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,033
It seems my confession
is making you uncomfortable.

223
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,167
No, it's not that.

224
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm not asking for an answer.

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
I was just frustrated.

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,433
If I didn't say it, it felt like
I was lying to myself. It's just venting.

227
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:07,233
Whether I hide my feelings
or hold them back, that's for me to handle.

228
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,867
So stop avoiding me from now on.

229
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,000
Because I want to keep seeing you.

230
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,467
Who's there?

231
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,467
Get over here, quick!

232
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,267
Still, you shouldn't shove someone like that.

233
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:22,400
I got a cramp! A cramp!

234
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:26,908
Jeez.

235
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,333
Says she has a cramp but runs just fine.

236
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,333
I told you.

237
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,167
I can't even breathe if I can't see you.

238
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,900
Not for a day, not even a single second.

239
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,833
You're my oxygen.

240
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,167
So don't avoid me.

241
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,100
I'm not avoiding you!

242
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,500
Then what is it?

243
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,900
You avoid eye contact,

244
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,933
run away when we meet,

245
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,167
and pretend not to hear me when I call you.

246
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:51,633
Well... I don't know
why I'm like this either.

247
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:53,467
Does this mean I'm falling for you?

248
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:55,167
Whether I hide my feelings or hold them back,

249
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,433
that's for me to handle.

250
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,100
So stop avoiding me from now on.

251
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,900
Because I want to keep seeing you.

252

Why is he being so honest?

253
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,267
Whenever I think of you,

254
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:10,433
my heart keeps going thump thump.

255
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:11,633
Don't hide those feelings.

256
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,067
- Did she...
- I'll take responsibility.

257
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,933
I thought she said Du Jun.

258
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:18,100
Ah, I must be crazy. Why am I like this?

259

I need to get a grip.

260

for the first-half of next year as is.

the promotional items tied
to food brand collaborations

264

seem to lack competitor analysis data.

265

What? What's wrong with me?

266

and we'll schedule a follow-up for details.

Ah, why is this happening? Is it defective?

280

It happens occasionally.

281
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,933
Of course.

Well then...

00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:19,967
We're the Sales Team here.

330
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:24,033
Yes, thank you.

331
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:26,600
We're swamped.

332
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,933
Sorry I'm late.

333
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,733
I'll get straight to the point.

334
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,333
Do you have a solution for this situation?

335
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,567
We're working on a solution.

336
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:44,800
Working on it?

337
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,033
Our Southeast Asia exports have collapsed.

338
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,433
The damages alone are 8 million dollars!

339
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:53,933
Does it make sense that Taehan Liquor
is shaking the entire group's stock price?

340
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:55,567
First the postpartum
care center beer incident,

341
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:57,933
then the new product plagiarism allegations.

342
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:59,633
With these back-to-back scandals,

343
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:02,900
people are even talking about owner risk now.

344
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,700
If we can't fix this,

345
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,292
it'll be hard to keep our footing.

346
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,084
That's right.

347
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,967
- That's enough.
- Right.

348
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,667
The model's DUI didn't happen
because of President Kang.

349
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,667
Questioning his management skills
over this is...

350
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,700
He said they're working on a solution.

351
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,200
Let's give him one more chance.

352
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,333
Has the CEO of REM Entertainment
responded yet?

353
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,767
They just notified us they'll join
the entertainment group meeting.

354
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:46,533
As they should.

355
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:48,967
Betraying me would only hurt them.

356
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:51,900
- The time?
- Reserved for 7 p.m.

357
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,967
Okay.

358
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:57,500
This should be enough of a warning.

359
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
People who like drinking often make mistakes.

360
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,467
The outdoor brands have already
quickly cut ties with Oh Jin Woo.

361
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,433
Let's replace our model quickly too.

362
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:09,067
We can't let our company name
be associated with a DUI offender.

363
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,667
Did you know there are memes
mocking Try Beer now?

364
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:14,067
That's why entertainment companies
are backing out.

365
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:15,267
They don't want to be
associated with controversy.

366
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,133
Did we encourage drinking?

367
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:19,233
Honestly, that actor messed up.

368
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:20,433
Exactly.

369
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:23,567
We built up exports to Southeast Asia
with this Asian Prince branding.

370
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:24,567
And this is how he repays us?

371
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:29,000
What do we do now? It'd be hard
to find someone with a clean record.

372
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,133
We have to find someone.

373
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:33,600
A new model to revitalize our image.

374
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,367
Four days should be enough, right?

375
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:37,267
Find a new model within four days?

376
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,300
No. Find one and shoot ads in four days.

377
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,533
Why is everyone so quiet?

378
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:48,900
This is an emergency.

379
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,733
The conditions are too strict.

380
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,933
It's not easy to find someone
better than Oh Jin Woo.

381
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:54,333
Who did you recommend, Team Leader?

382
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,633
- Ji Eun Kyu.
- What?

383
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:56,667
He's an idol.

384
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,067
Look at his eyes.

385
00:24:58,067 --> 00:24:59,267
How pure they are!

386
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:02,633
When I look into those eyes,
I feel my soul being cleansed.

387
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,000
Come on, he's not sexy.

388
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,967
What then? All the A-list actors
are being blocked by their agencies.

389
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:09,333
Does the model really need to be famous?

390
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,333
Try Beer has many loyal customers,

391
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,933
so a fresh face might work.

392
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:14,000
True.

393
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,567
Isn't there a sexy man like a bitter stout?

394
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:23,333
A sexy man...

395
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,500
No idea.

396
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,100
Clueless.

397
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,533
What should we do?

398
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,500
See? You have no answers either.

399
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,833
Kang Du Jun.

400
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:41,200
Huh? Did you just say Kang Du Jun?

401
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
- Yes.
- Huh?

402
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,400
What?

403
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,267
- Me?
- You just said Kang Du Jun.

404
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:53,567
No, that's not what I meant.

405
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,667
Oh, that's kind of brilliant.

406
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,700
Crazy. The President as our model?

407
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,067
But President Kang has that sexy vibe, right?

408
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:01,167
No, no.

409
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:02,900
I was just spouting nonsense for a second.

410
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,867
No, it's not bad.

411
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:07,633
Since you brought it up, make a proposal too.

412
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,833
- Me?
- Yes.

413
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,767
We don't have time if we want
to shoot within four days.

414
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:15,033
This is the time to shine,
so our team gets some credit.

415
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,800
- Right?
- Exactly.

416
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,533
Having the President as our model!

417
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,433
Isn't that insane?

418
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:26,700
I asked them to find a new model,
and their solution is me? Are you kidding?

419
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Why not?

420
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,600
I thought it was perfect
as soon as I heard it.

421
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,644
Look!

422
00:26:31,644 --> 00:26:33,867
[Proposal]
The new proposal with you as the model.

423
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:37,200
Isn't this exactly the brilliant idea
to turn crisis into opportunity?

424
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,933
No, forget that. Who did it?

425
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:42,400
Seriously, who proposed this ridiculous plan?

426
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,100
Well...

427
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,167
It's Manager Jang?

428
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:54,400
I brought her as you requested,
so you two can discuss it.

429
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,500
Surprise!

430
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,033
What do you think?

431
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:08,067
Why not make your debut as a model?

432
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:12,667
So, you pictured me as a sexy guy

433
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:15,833
like a slightly bitter stout?

434
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,100
Isn't this practically a confession?

435
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,200
That's not it.

436
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,900
It's not? Then fine. I guess I don't
have a reason to do it either.

437
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,033
Wait, what I meant was...

438
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,600
Manager Jang is leaving now.

439
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,333
No, I mean...

440
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:30,033
As soon as I heard the concept,

441
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:32,767
you were the only person
I thought of, President.

442
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,467
The more I worked on the proposal,

443
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:38,367
the clearer it became that our brand
identity and your image

444
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,867
are a perfect match.

445
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:43,933
[Try Beer]
Look here.

446
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,767
Try Beer's signature clean, refreshing image

447
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,800
combined with the new urban,
sophisticated masculinity we're adding...

448
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,900
Okay.

449
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,500
Understood.

450
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,967
Seems like you really
studied me in a short time.

451
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:00,867
Well, in that case,
I'll accept, but I have one condition.

452
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,667
A condition?

453
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,367
You've been through a lot.

454
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,300
So I heard he accepted after setting
some kind of condition?

455
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,300
Yeah, right.

456
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,067
Agreeing to his condition
should've been enough.

457
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:28,300
Why do you have to show up
at the set where he's shooting?

458
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,367
I'm fine.

459
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,833
But is the President really okay?

460
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:34,367
Yeah, he doesn't look okay at all.

461
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:41,433
Where's the brave soul that'll tell him 'no'?

462
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,100
Alright, President!

463
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,033
Drink the beer and show us
a joyful expression.

464
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,233
Oh, gosh.

465
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,267
Well, just...

466
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:56,233
Give us a bright smile.

467
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:59,600
Drink the beer, cheer,

468
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,300
and flash a bright smile.

469
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,033
Smile.

470
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,233
Sm... Smile.

471
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:07,633
Ugh, jeez.

472
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:08,800
What are you all doing?

473
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Say something!

474
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Man, even a robot would
smile better than that.

475
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,200
Oh.

476
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,233
Let's take a 10-minute break.

477
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,900
Yes, okay.

478
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,933
Oh, my.

479
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:27,500
Will a break make him smile?

480
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:32,267
It's his first time.

481
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:34,200
But I'm genuinely curious.

482
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,233
How much cooler the President
will look all dressed up.

483
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,033
He'll look like a celebrity, won't he?

484
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:40,733
Even as a fellow man, I admit he's handsome.

485
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:42,400
Looking at him

486
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,067
takes me back to my 20s.

487
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:47,100
If I dressed up,
I could rival a celebrity too.

488
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,733
Exactly. If they're shooting at the company,
we should sneak a peek.

489
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,000
Where's the shoot?

490
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,267
Team Leader, if it's close, are you going?

491
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:58,833
Why not?

492
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,767
Huh? I got the location from Manager Jang.

493
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:01,833
Oh my goodness.

494
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,300
It'd be great if you put
this much effort in every day.

495
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,600
It's closer to the office than expected.

496
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,133
Really? Let's go check it out.

497
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,433
Can we really go check it out?

498
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,533
Secretary Go will be with the President,

499
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:15,333
so won't Manager Jang feel
left out if no one's with her?

500
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:18,267
As teammates, nothing wrong with going.

501
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:20,000
So, should I start the car now?

502
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,567
We can't go empty-handed.
Should we get coffee and dessert?

503
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,433
There's that new cafe in front of the office.

504
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:26,467
Word is their coffee is really good.

505
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:27,533
Shall we buy some?

506
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:28,867
- Deal!
- Deal.

507
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:31,967
But we have to finish the proposal today.

508
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:33,333
Is everyone really okay time-wise?

509
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,567
Oh, right.

510
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,633
That's why we came in on the weekend.

511
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:39,667
If that proposal is the issue,
we'll have to handle it tonight.

512
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,500
I really want to go too,

513
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,067
but I have plans with a friend tonight.

514
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:46,400
Ugh, my little bunnies at home
are waiting for me.

515
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,333
I need to rush home
to take over parenting duties.

516
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,233
I have a book club meeting.

517
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:53,333
Tak Soo always seems to
have plans whenever I see him.

518
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,100
Well, if no one can make it, I'll skip too.

519
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,000
I guess I should text my crush.

520
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,200
Ugh, seems like today's just not our day.

521
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,333
Everyone seems busy this weekend,
so let's wrap this up quickly and go.

522
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,233
Understood.

523
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:07,800
Hey, you're really not going, huh?

524
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,533
I won't ask twice, okay?

525
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:11,733
You're really not going?

526
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:14,200
I won't ask thrice.

527
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:30,033
But this mirror only shows my nose.

528
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,633
Restrained emotions naturally
look more sophisticated.

529
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:34,900
People just don't get that.

530
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,067
What's so important
about looking sophisticated?

531
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:38,933
It has to feel more real than reality itself.

532
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:41,033
Only then will people crave beer
just from seeing the ad.

533
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:43,367
I'm not even a real actor.
How am I supposed to do that?

534
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,533
And can't we replace that director?

535
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:47,700
He keeps getting annoyed at everything.

536
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
Watch me.

537
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,200
Now, imagine you're copying me.

538
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,700
Make your eyes like shrimp.

539
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,733
Pull your cheekbones up as high as possible.

540
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:58,033
Smile.

541
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,500
Why aren't you looking at me?

542
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,000
Now, try it like this.

543
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,433
Up, up, up.

544
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,633
That's it.

545
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:17,700
Wait, is this really right?

546
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,267
Earlier you complained I looked like a robot.

547
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:23,164
Then watch me.

548
00:32:23,164 --> 00:32:25,116
Hey!

549
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:27,467
Huh? You smiled.

550
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:28,533
See? It works.

551
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:29,633
You look cool when you smile.

552
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:30,967
Now.

553
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:32,200
What am I supposed to do?

554
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,167
Just once, just once.

555
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,900
Do it just once for me, please.

556
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,233
What do you mean 'just once'? Forget it.

557
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,267
Why? Please do it, just once.

558
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:42,800
- Just once.
- No.

559
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,276
- What...
- Just do this once for me.

560
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh, oh.

561
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,167
Oh, good. Good.

562
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,167
Okay, okay.

563
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,267
What happened in that short time?

564
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:57,667
So natural! One more time!

565
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:02,556
Yeah!

566
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,333
Good, well done.

567
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,600
Much better.

568
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,967
Newborn clothes are this tiny?

569
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:14,333
Wow, so adorable.

570
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:18,067
But I still don't know Yeol Mu's gender.

571
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:25,267
Who cares? Pink works for
both boys and girls.

572
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:26,800
Oh my, it's too cute.

573
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,567
How about this one?

574
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,867
Hello? Hey, focus, focus.

575
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:32,867
You're acting weird today.

576
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:34,467
You've been glued to your phone all day.

577
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:38,267
She's been at the shoot
for ages, and still no reply?

578
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,433
Guess she's busy.

579
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:41,333
I heard today's shoot is important.

580
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,400
Aren't you going to pick one?

581
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,200
You asked me to pick a present for Hui Won.

582
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,800
This, a pregnancy gift.

583
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,567
I never said it was a pregnancy gift, though.

584
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,033
Huh?

585
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:55,400
Hey, it's not even her birthday yet.
Should we make up a random holiday to buy it?

586
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,033
Why? Don't you want to buy it for her?

587
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:00,867
No, that's not it.

588
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:05,533
Fine, let's take a look.

589
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:07,433
See this. Isn't it adorable?

590
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:10,000
It even has pockets, look.

591
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,767
It is kinda cute.

592
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,667
Why that reaction?

593
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,433
Then how about this? This is super cute too.

594
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:19,333
Check this out.

595
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,267
Just buy whatever you like.

596
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,000
Whatever you pick will look pretty anyway.

597
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,033
Hey, Cha Min Uk.

598
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:26,267
Maybe I'm hungry, so I can't focus.

599
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:27,600
Shall we grab something to eat?

600
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,300
Let's go.

601
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,933
Why's he acting like that today?

602
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,800
Right, going to the shoot won't help.

603
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Should be working instead.

604
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,600
Weekend work isn't new.

605
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,933
That's just how I am.

606
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:45,300
- Oh! You scared me!
- Oh.

607
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
Goodness! What are you doing, Manager Nah?

608
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,533
You startled me.

609
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:49,567
Why'd you come back?

610
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:52,667
Well, my wife just called
saying she took the kids to her parents'.

611
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:56,467
What? That means you're free!
Isn't that great? Why come back?

612
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:59,767
Every day it's chaotic,
but weekends alone feel too lonely.

613
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:01,433
Might as well catch up on work.

614
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,167
Huh? But why aren't you
going home, Team Leader?

615
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,267
I'm Team Leader Bang.

616
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:07,633
Gotta do at least this much
to keep my team leader position.

617
00:35:10,716 --> 00:35:13,400
Oh my!

618
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,300
Why are you here, Assistant Manager Choi?

619
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,833
Now that I think about it,

620
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:19,800
Manager Jang and I joined
the company together.

621
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,267
But I'm still an assistant manager.

622
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm going to work hard
and aim for a promotion.

623
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,633
Isn't it that your crush hasn't replied?

624
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:27,900
No, it's not!

625
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,133
Didn't you already leave?

626
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, you scared me!
I left my book club book here.

627
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,400
I just came back to get this.

628
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,133
Well, I should get going...

629
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:39,833
Get going...

630
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,600
I think it's okay to slip up once in a while.

631
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,167
Huh? Why are you still here?

632
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:52,700
The main character always shows up last.

633
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,033
The future of our Taehan Liquor.

634
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:56,633
I knew you'd come back.

635
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:58,833
Look at how tight our team is.

636
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,033
Gives me chills.

637
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,333
Well, yes.

638
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,833
We are the future of Taehan Liquor.

639
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:07,100
I'm feeling generous. Coffee's on me today!

640
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,300
What's the occasion?

641
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,200
You used to stretch every penny
raising three kids.

642
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,167
On a day like today,
how could I not buy coffee?

643
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:14,733
Tak Soo! That coffee shop earlier.

644
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,000
- Yes.
- Let's try

645
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,200
that famous coffee.

646
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,967
Yes, I'll get you there safely.

647
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,667
Wait, stop!

648
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:26,833
Where did you learn
to pull out your card in front of a senior?

649
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:30,567
The famous coffee plus dessert,
I'm buying today.

650
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:31,967
Now, follow me!

651
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,333
Great!

652
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:36,667
Coffee! Coffee!

653
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:37,852
Alright, let's enjoy that together.

654
00:36:37,852 --> 00:36:39,964
Oh.

655

00:55:28,567 --> 00:55:30,733
It's an honor for us to be working with you.

980
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:32,633
I'm very happy too.

981
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,567
If it gets tough this time,
will you let go of her hand again?

982
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:40,300
Like last time?

983
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,633
President?

984

[Global partnership between
Taehan Liquor and JINSH Co]

985
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,467
No problem.

986
00:56:11,633 --> 00:56:13,433
Don't let go.

987
00:56:13,433 --> 00:56:16,167
Don't give up, please, brother.

988
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,367
Brother, please.

989
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:20,067
Brother! No!

990
00:56:21,433 --> 00:56:23,420
What do I do?

991
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:27,667
Will you let go of her hand again?

992
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:29,367
Like last time?

993
00:57:08,533 --> 00:57:11,633
President, are you not feeling well?

994
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,567
You are burning.

995
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:19,933
If you feel dizzy, maybe lean on me?

996
00:58:41,628 --> 00:58:43,708
[Epilogue]

997
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,600
Oh, you startled me!

998
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,667
Why are you so surprised?

999
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:50,867
Why are you so late?

1000
00:58:50,867 --> 00:58:52,600
There's a meeting in 20 minutes!

1001
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,933
I didn't want to be late.

1002
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:57,333
When I go outside now,
people won't leave me alone.

1003
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,367
But they leave you alone just fine.

1004
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:00,000
You don't know how the world works, do you?

1005
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,500
If I go outside, there are
people recognizing me now.

1006
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,433
Manager Jang just happened to see that.

1007
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:10,767
Oh, thrilling. Feels so new.

1008
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:12,333
Are you excited about getting fans?

1009
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,700
Or are you excited because Manager Jang
saw and got jealous?

1010
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,200
A tall figure like this can't be hidden.

1011
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,100
With that nose bridge and those deep eyes,

1012
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,633
they're truly one of a kind.

1013
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:24,667
That's what Manager Jang said.

1014
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,067
Goodness.

1015
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:30,100
You were all like 'who on earth
came up with this idea?'

1016
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,367
And now you're looking so happy.

1017
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:35,733
And what exactly did you
make Manager Jang promise?

1018
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:37,900
You don't need to know.

1019
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:41,333
By the way, where did this mirror
come from? I can only see my nose.

1020
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:42,367
Hey, that's mine.

1021
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:45,967
It's yours? Even your mirror's
a mini version of you.

1022
00:59:47,388 --> 00:59:50,133
Jeez. If you model twice, it's really
going to be a big deal.

1023
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:51,367
Oh, right.

1024
00:59:51,367 --> 00:59:53,667
Can you get me a hat and mask?

1025
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:56,300
- Why?
- What if people recognize me?

1026
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,833
Manager Jang said that again.

1027
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:02,000
You're so annoying.

1028
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,533
Give it to me.

1029
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:45,633
It's almost time to get off work.

1030
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:46,876
Do you like Jang Hui Won?

1031
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:47,932
Is that not allowed?

1032
01:00:47,932 --> 01:00:49,700
Are you trying to pick a fight right now?

1033
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,867
You keep acting childish
while competing with the President.

1034
01:00:51,867 --> 01:00:52,900
You've been acting strange lately.

1035
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,200
- Get out.
- Do you really not know why I'm like this?

1036
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,800
Give me Taehan Liquor.

1037
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,933
What if I say no?

1038
01:00:57,933 --> 01:01:01,467
You'll see for yourself why you
have no choice but to say yes.

1039
01:01:01,467 --> 01:01:03,033
It's a safe and reliable place.

1040
01:01:03,033 --> 01:01:04,467
I told you I'm keeping this baby.

1041
01:01:04,467 --> 01:01:06,000
A shameful secret
I never want anyone to know?

1042
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,200
That's the kind of relationship it is.

1043
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,067
For me, that day was really wonderful.
