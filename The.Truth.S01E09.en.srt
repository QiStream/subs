2
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,136
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:26,022
I remember you loved
Rembrandt most back then.

4
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:30,022
You always said his paintings
carried a tragic tone.

5
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:33,080
What about you?

6
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,302
Do you still like Monet?

7
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:37,703
No, not anymore.

8
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:46,223
Do you still paint?

9
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:50,680
And you?

10
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,143
What do you do now?

11
00:01:54,503 --> 00:01:55,503
I don't paint either.

12
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:57,803
Now,

13
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:00,102
I run a small business.

14
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:16,743
Remember how we used to come here
after evening self-study?

15
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:24,102
Yes.

16
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:29,063
People say you should look forward.

17
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:32,312
But some things

18
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,183
just can't be forgotten.

19
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:45,743
Like this place.

20
00:02:47,623 --> 00:02:52,542
I still remember us sitting
right over there discussing Rembrandt.

21
00:03:13,023 --> 00:03:14,623
This is my favorite painting.

22
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,623
What do you like about Rembrandt?

23
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:21,903
Some say

24
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:25,422
Rembrandt's art depicts the struggle
between light and dark.

25
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,623
What do you think?

26
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:31,503
I agree.

27
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,183
Light and dark
are inherently intertwined.

28
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:36,903
Just like this world.

29
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,582
There's sunlight, and there are shadows.

30
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:45,343
That's why I never
really liked Rembrandt.

31
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:48,023
I prefer Monet,

32
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:50,142
always standing solely in the sunlight.

33
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:55,704
How lucky must one be

34
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:58,296
to always stand in the light.

35
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,503
Let's talk next time.

36
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:23,582
Dan Qing.

37
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:27,983
Take care.

38
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:31,983
You too.

39
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:00,462
Here, your favorite qingbuliang.

40
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:03,103
Jing, you dote on me most.

41
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:14,142
Did you meet the nephew of Tang's wife?

42
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,262
We added on social media,
but haven't met.

43
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:19,902
Why? What happened?

44
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:23,743
Nothing to talk about.

45
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:25,183
What would we talk about?

46
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:28,142
How could you not know
what to talk about?

47
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:30,983
Our jobs are completely different.

48
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,183
He's at the Forestry Bureau.

49
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:34,183
We just don't connect.

50
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:36,983
So you...

51
00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:40,543
You two should talk
about things outside work.

52
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:42,183
Like what?

53
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,983
Like movies,

54
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:47,582
art,

55
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:49,142
pop songs,

56
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:50,743
food,

57
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,983
and anything young people like.

58
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:55,943
Jing, you know how it is.

59
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:58,382
I barely have time
to pay attention to any of that.

60
00:05:58,382 --> 00:05:59,702
Just making small talk?

61
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:03,743
I'm really at my wits' end
with you cops.

62
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:05,022
Well...

63
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:13,462
For us, it's just the same
three points every day:

64
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:15,822
the station, home, and here.

65
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:19,063
The most relaxing part of my day
is eating something at your place.

66
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:23,303
And the thing we care about most
is solving cases.

67
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:25,303
Nothing else much.

68
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:29,743
I can see it now.

69
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:34,543
Your love life will only be solved
within the police department.

70
00:07:45,543 --> 00:07:46,822
Let me show you something good.

71
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:52,423
Here.

72
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:04,382
How is it?

73
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:05,423
Do you like it?

74
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:35,663
It smells amazing!

75
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:37,783
How did you know I hadn't eaten?

76
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:40,383
What is this you cooked?

77
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,543
What's wrong now?

78
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,742
Weren't you on a date
with your unrequited love today?

79
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:01,222
How was it? Tell me.

80
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,183
Mind your own business.

81
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:09,383
You're in a bad mood.

82
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,183
Something's bothering you. Talk to me.

83
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:17,183
Won't say?

84
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:18,982
Then I'm going to eat noodles.

85
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:31,742
(Dongyuan Community
Convenience Health Service Station)

86
00:09:31,742 --> 00:09:32,702
I never expected

87
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:36,502
that Niu Bosheng really lost
his bag and clothes.

88
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:38,582
This guy is so twisted.

89
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,663
He must have planned it long ago.

90
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:42,543
That's possible.

91
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,512
But getting people who barely know him

92
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:48,742
to remember something from months ago

93
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,383
was still quite risky, wasn't it?

94
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:51,903
Captain Sun.

95
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:54,903
Why are you speaking up for Niu Bosheng?

96
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:19,462
You know you had a dream last night?

97
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:20,742
Dream talk.

98
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:23,663
What did I say?

99
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:25,622
What could it be?

100
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:28,143
Just kept saying one person's name.

101
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,742
Yumo.

102
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:01,943
It is all Wang Xiaole.

103
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,063
There are words too.

104
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:08,222
May 17, 2005.

105
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:09,462
School organized spring outing.

106
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:12,183
This is the first photo
I took of Xiaole.

107
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:13,622
Xiaole looks beautiful.

108
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,063
Like an angel.

109
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,063
December 30, 2006.

110
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:22,063
New Year's Gala.

111
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:24,903
Xiaole's singing was so beautiful.

112
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,543
June 2008.

113
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:31,063
Grade-wide group photo.

114
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,143
What a pity.

115
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:35,822
Our class wasn't next to Xiaole's class.

116
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:38,263
That's so corny.

117
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,342
This guy is really lovesick.

118
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,822
These photos
are arranged chronologically.

119
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:47,342
No close-ups, all taken secretly.

120
00:11:57,982 --> 00:11:59,502
Condoms of the same brand.

121
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:01,183
Round packaging.

122
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,822
Also arranged chronologically.

123
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,023
But why are all the wrappers
under the tree square?

124
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:18,462
The packaging of these condoms

125
00:12:18,462 --> 00:12:19,702
is of different colors.

126
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:21,462
They weren't tossed on the same day.

127
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:26,822
This type of condom
shouldn't be commercially available.

128
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:29,222
They should be
free family planning supplies.

129
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:30,462
Officer,

130
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:34,183
I suggest you ask the family planning,
neighborhood committee, and hospitals.

131
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:03,063
(Mutt)

132
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:04,663
I've already told you.

133
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:06,502
I didn't kill Xiaole.

134
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:08,742
You don't need to waste your time on me.

135
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:10,502
Why don't you go find the real killer?

136
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:12,903
Niu Bosheng,

137
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:16,102
you're an educated person.

138
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:17,303
You should understand

139
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:21,303
that we wouldn't have brought you here
without solid evidence.

140
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:23,783
Put it this way.

141
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:28,143
The evidence we have
points overwhelmingly to you.

142
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:34,063
The reason we're still
talking to you here

143
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,663
is to give you a chance to confess.

144
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:40,383
In my lifetime,

145
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:42,582
I dare to admit what I do.

146
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:44,582
I'll never shirk it.

147
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:47,502
But for things I didn't do,

148
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:50,742
whether it's here,
the procuratorate, or the court,

149
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:51,663
I won't admit.

150
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:52,742
Because I didn't do it.

151
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:59,102
How long have you known Wang Xiaole?

152
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:01,063
17 years.

153
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:04,102
Did she know you loved her?

154
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,342
No.

155
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,663
You never confessed to her?

156
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:13,622
I've said it before.

157
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:17,742
Watching her from afar
was enough for me.

158
00:14:19,102 --> 00:14:20,702
After Xiaole got together with Wu Da,

159
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,502
I gradually realized

160
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,303
that I projected myself onto Wu Da.

161
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:27,582
When they were together,

162
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:30,063
it felt like I was with Xiaole.

163
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:33,383
To be honest,

164
00:14:33,943 --> 00:14:35,462
if you truly love someone,

165
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:39,582
her happiness becomes your happiness.

166
00:14:41,222 --> 00:14:42,702
Xiaole chose Wu Da.

167
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,102
And I sincerely wished them well.

168
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:47,702
I hope they'll have a long, happy,
and peaceful marriage.

169
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,502
Then one day, they got divorced.

170
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:55,383
Honestly, I was pretty down for a while.

171
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:59,222
But later I figured it out.

172
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:01,720
Xiaole could find happiness

173
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,982
with Huang Chong.

174
00:15:05,143 --> 00:15:07,032
And she could get rid

175
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:09,462
of Wu Da, that deadbeat.

176
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:18,742
Wang Xiaole and Huang Chong
were already planning to get married.

177
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:22,303
They planned to move downtown
after the wedding.

178
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:26,222
No more peeping this time, right?

179
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:30,622
Huang Chong owns
two properties in Yunxi.

180
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:32,728
The most suitable place for marriage

181
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,023
is the Riverside Garden in downtown.

182
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:40,303
I rented an apartment
across from their complex.

183
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:44,982
The location and view are great.

184
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:47,263
Come in.

185
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:50,582
Master, Captain Sun,
may I ask a few questions?

186
00:15:58,063 --> 00:15:59,663
You called Wu Da a deadbeat.

187
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:00,582
What did you mean?

188
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:03,303
After they divorced,

189
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:07,502
Wu Da would constantly
harass Xiaole at her place.

190
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:09,383
And he borrowed a lot of money
from Xiaole too.

191
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,502
Wu Da really

192
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,183
has no shame as a man.

193
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:16,822
Before the divorce,
he was always jealous of Xiaole.

194
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,102
And he hit her.

195
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:22,263
After the divorce, he clung to her
like a leech, pestering her endlessly.

196
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:24,502
You witnessed Wu Da hitting Wang Xiaole?

197
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:28,502
A few times.

198
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:30,303
But it wasn't severe.

199
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:31,742
They mostly argued.

200
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:05,663
I don't want this life any longer!

201
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:07,062
Go live it by yourself!

202
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,462
Useless!

203
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:09,423
Say that to me again!

204
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:10,462
Say it again!

205
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,032
Useless!

206
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:11,640
You...

207
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:13,623
Let go of me!

208
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:14,502
Say it to me again!

209
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,343
Useless! You are useless!

210
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:17,583
You are useless!

211
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,222
Coward!

212
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:21,383
All you can do is hit women!

213
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:24,542
Don't touch me!

214
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:25,183
How dare you!

215
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:25,742
Let go!

216
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:26,823
How dare you defy me!

217
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:28,143
How dare you!

218
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:31,702
Disappear!

219
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:32,222
You!

220
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:36,742
Let me go!

221
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,702
Let me go!

222
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:48,702
They argued a lot?

223
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,383
Yes.

224
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:55,903
Haven't you ever thought
about standing up for Wang Xiaole?

225
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,742
They made up quickly after every fight.

226
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:03,823
Besides, Xiaole chose Wu Da herself.

227
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:07,903
I can't and won't
make any decisions for her.

228
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,903
But I-I did end up
regretting it a bit later.

229
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:16,302
Why did I have to lend Wu Da the money
to buy that apartment?

230
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:17,782
Without that apartment, Xiaole...

231
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,062
This is yours, right?

232
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:27,542
Yes.

233
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:30,262
Did you save every single

234
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,022
condom wrapper?

235
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:44,903
They're proof of love
between Xiaole and me.

236
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:48,143
Not a single one was lost or missed?

237
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:53,903
This brand isn't common here.

238
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:55,302
How did you get them?

239
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:56,423
From overseas sites.

240
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,903
I have payment records. You can check.

241
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:00,903
Have you ever switched brands?

242
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,022
No.

243
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,623
Once I set my mind on something,
I stick to it.

244
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,302
Did anyone else know
about your collection habit?

245
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,183
How could I let
anyone else know about it?

246
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:34,823
Master,

247
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:37,903
if Niu Bosheng is telling the truth.

248
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,302
He never used
any other brand of contraceptive.

249
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:44,302
Then what about those wrappers
in the pine forest?

250
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:46,663
Given Niu Bosheng's personality,

251
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:48,903
even if he used a different brand,

252
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:51,183
he would have taken
the wrapper back to keep.

253
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:52,943
He wouldn't have left it at the scene.

254
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,143
Captain Leng, Ye.

255
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:57,943
Listen.

256
00:19:57,982 --> 00:19:59,623
I investigated
at the community hospital.

257
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,383
Niu Bosheng's locker
was indeed broken into.

258
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:04,183
The clothes and bag really were stolen.

259
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:08,143
His colleagues at the community hospital
can confirm all this.

260
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,823
But since there's
no surveillance footage,

261
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:16,583
we can't rule out
that he staged it himself.

262
00:20:16,823 --> 00:20:20,663
After all, the DNA evidence
points directly to him now.

263
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:25,462
But it's also true that Niu Bosheng
rented a place near Huang Chong's home

264
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:27,022
before the crime occurred.

265
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:29,423
If he really planned to commit murder,

266
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:31,903
there'd be no reason for him to do that.

267
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:36,343
Master,

268
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:40,462
don't you think we found
Niu Bosheng a little too easily?

269
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:44,542
If no third party knew
about his collecting habit,

270
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,022
then those wrappers in the pine forest

271
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,143
were planted there intentionally

272
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:50,782
to lead us straight to Niu Bosheng.

273
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:55,623
Also, if Niu Bosheng
is telling the truth,

274
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:58,823
that means Wu Da lied to us.

275
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:04,062
His relationship with Wang Xiaole
might not be as good as he claimed.

276
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,423
Officers, you're back again.

277
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:08,952
(Shancheng Community)

278
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,982
(If those condom wrappers
were planted intentionally,)

279
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:15,742
(then the real killer passing the gate)

280
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:18,222
(was likely intentional too.)

281
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:22,383
(He did it to lead us to the pond)

282
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:24,943
(and let us find
the critical clothing evidence.)

283
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:26,943
(So we'd incriminate Niu Bosheng.)

284
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:30,168
(He must have planned an exit strategy)

285
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,583
(before doing this.)

286
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:35,183
(An exit route hidden
from surveillance cameras.)

287
00:23:41,383 --> 00:23:42,343
Everyone, gather round.

288
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,143
(Convenience Service Center)

289
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:50,302
We need all surveillance footage
around this community hospital.

290
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:53,742
Don't overlook any camera
that might've caught the bag thief.

291
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:55,222
Understood.

292
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,022
Six months.

293
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:01,222
It's nearly the maximum retention period
for public area surveillance.

294
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,222
Would he time the theft
right before the footage expired?

295
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,903
It's possible.

296
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:08,062
Niu Bosheng seems pretty twisted.

297
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:09,583
Maybe he did it himself.

298
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,462
Classic hypocrisy.

299
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:12,343
We still have to investigate.

300
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:12,903
Yes.

301
00:24:12,903 --> 00:24:14,343
Move out. Spread the search.

302
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,143
Yes.

303
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:15,823
Over there.

304
00:24:15,982 --> 00:24:17,022
And there. Find more.

305
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:17,502
Got it.

306
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:49,222
You lent Wu Da that 200,000 yuan
for his apartment, right?

307
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:52,143
That money actually
came from Niu Bosheng.

308
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,943
Truth is, I wasn't particularly close
with Niu Bosheng.

309
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:57,742
He just approached me
out of the blue once,

310
00:24:57,982 --> 00:25:01,623
asking me to lend the money
to Wu Da under my name.

311
00:25:03,222 --> 00:25:05,702
Did Wu Da know about this?

312
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:08,103
He probably found out.

313
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,663
After he repaid the loan,

314
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:12,663
during a class reunion,

315
00:25:14,022 --> 00:25:15,143
I got drunk

316
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:16,343
and spilled the truth.

317
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:18,742
Wu Da was sitting right
next to me at the time.

318
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:20,943
Logically, he should have heard it.

319
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:22,702
But I'm really not sure.

320
00:26:10,623 --> 00:26:11,262
Sir.

321
00:26:11,663 --> 00:26:12,262
Excuse me.

322
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:13,782
Is the surveillance camera yours?

323
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:14,742
Yes, it is.

324
00:26:14,742 --> 00:26:15,302
What's up?

325
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:18,183
I'm from the police department.

326
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:20,823
I'd like to know if you keep
the footage from six months ago?

327
00:26:20,823 --> 00:26:21,462
Yes.

328
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:23,542
Great! Where is it?

329
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,222
Over here.

330
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:24,782
Okay.

331
00:26:56,222 --> 00:26:57,222
Niu Bosheng?

332
00:26:59,262 --> 00:27:00,062
I remember him.

333
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:02,502
I fought with him back in school.

334
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:04,143
(Yunxi Police)

335
00:27:04,143 --> 00:27:05,103
So it really was him?

336
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:08,502
So far,

337
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:11,022
the evidence directly points to him.

338
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:13,823
He's twisted.

339
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:15,782
Never thought after all these years,

340
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:17,623
he...

341
00:27:19,823 --> 00:27:20,623
It's all my fault.

342
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:22,903
I didn't protect Xiaole.

343
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:26,183
Alright.

344
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:27,502
Calm down.

345
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:31,103
Tell us what you know about Niu Bosheng.

346
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,222
I don't know much either.

347
00:27:35,462 --> 00:27:37,702
I think he works as a doctor
at a major hospital.

348
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:39,702
Do you know

349
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:43,022
that for your wedding apartment,

350
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:47,903
part of the money was loaned by him
under another classmate's name?

351
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:49,423
I don't know.

352
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,302
If I had known it was his money,

353
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,542
I wouldn't have taken it.

354
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:59,462
You are very familiar with the area
around Shancheng Community, right?

355
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:04,903
Have you been to that patch
of woods north of it?

356
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:09,143
I probably went there
when I was buying the house.

357
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:10,423
But not since then.

358
00:28:11,462 --> 00:28:12,823
You know the Dongyuan Community?

359
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:16,903
That urban village, right?

360
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:17,823
Have you been there?

361
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,462
Before the divorce,
I bought groceries there.

362
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:22,742
Are you sure?

363
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:26,302
Then do you know

364
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:31,663
Niu Bosheng holds a weekly clinic
at the Dongyuan Community Hospital?

365
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:34,502
No, I didn't.

366
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:48,914
(Tuxi Express Supermarket)

367
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:09,343
Tired?

368
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:11,103
If you are tired, take a break.

369
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:14,583
That parcel pickup point owner
really went all out.

370
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:15,542
From 8 AM to 10 PM,

371
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:17,022
365 days a year,

372
00:29:17,183 --> 00:29:19,062
he doesn't delete
a single bit of footage.

373
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:20,383
He gets a new one once it's full.

374
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,583
And it's all HD.

375
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:24,742
If other places
had surveillance like this,

376
00:29:24,903 --> 00:29:26,222
how much easier our job would be.

377
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,462
These parcel pickup services

378
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:32,462
often deal with issues
like lost packages, damaged items,

379
00:29:32,462 --> 00:29:33,702
items taken by mistake,

380
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:35,302
and even people stealing packages.

381
00:29:36,183 --> 00:29:38,143
I guess they're sick of the hassle too.

382
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:39,782
They've been scared.

383
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:45,823
Hello?

384
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:47,623
Where are you?

385
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:49,903
Okay, I'm coming out right now.

386
00:29:53,903 --> 00:29:54,502
Jing.

387
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:56,143
Bringing food for Lei?

388
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:57,302
Yes. Busy, huh?

389
00:29:57,302 --> 00:29:57,903
I need to go.

390
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:06,262
What brings you here?

391
00:30:06,623 --> 00:30:07,502
Bringing you food.

392
00:30:07,943 --> 00:30:08,663
Porridge.

393
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:09,663
Nice!

394
00:30:09,823 --> 00:30:11,262
Looks like you'll work late again.

395
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:13,343
Go eat it now.

396
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:14,583
I need to walk the little one.

397
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:15,462
Okay.

398
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,462
Take it slow on the way back.
Be careful.

399
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,008
Long and the others might be hungry.
I brought enough for all.

400
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:24,502
Head back now.

401
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:29,702
Bye.

402
00:30:38,663 --> 00:30:40,143
- What's that?
- Coming.

403
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:41,702
Fuel is coming.

404
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:43,903
Let me see what's good?

405
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,502
Here, take two boxes.

406
00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:47,302
One box is enough.

407
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:48,062
Just one box?

408
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:52,222
Ziwu.

409
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:53,183
Come on.

410
00:30:55,623 --> 00:30:58,062
Jing really knows how to look after us.

411
00:30:58,062 --> 00:30:59,183
Wouldn't let us go hungry.

412
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:00,742
You must have smelled it.

413
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,143
I was about to bring yours over.

414
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:03,143
Jing brought it.

415
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:03,903
Yeah.

416
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:07,502
Come on. Eat up and then back to work.

417
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:08,343
Tastes great.

418
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:17,982
Don't just eat.

419
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:19,143
Have some water.

420
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:22,823
I'll open it.

421
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:24,022
I'm leaving.

422
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:26,742
Lei.

423
00:31:27,982 --> 00:31:28,823
What? Get in.

424
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:30,583
Is there any new discovery?

425
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:31,663
Nothing yet.

426
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:34,742
You should go eat too.

427
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:37,462
Call me if you find anything.

428
00:31:37,502 --> 00:31:38,143
Okay.

429
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:39,903
Eat slowly.

00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:58,104
(Tuxi Express Supermarket)

432
00:31:59,623 --> 00:32:00,423
Captain Leng,

433
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:01,782
come here.

434
00:32:04,103 --> 00:32:04,742
Look.

435
00:32:09,462 --> 00:32:10,262
Wu Da?

436
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:13,623
Wu Da framed Niu Bosheng.

437
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,462
But during the time of the incident,

438
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:20,262
the dog-walking uncle clearly saw
Wu Da drinking in the flower bed.

439
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:31,982
Let's go.

440
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:36,183
Yes.

441
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,262
Still the same path every day.

442
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:43,502
Another one?

443
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:47,782
Young people

444
00:32:48,742 --> 00:32:50,062
drink heavily.

(What's the injury on your hand?)

446
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:31,502
I forgot too.

447
00:41:32,343 --> 00:41:34,223
Probably bumped into something.

448
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:38,662
Mao, let's go home.

449
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:42,303
Happy now?

450
00:41:45,982 --> 00:41:47,182
How'd you get over here?

451
00:41:47,182 --> 00:41:48,062
Come here.

452
00:41:55,223 --> 00:41:56,022
