1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,492
You didn't trust me, so you followed me?

2
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:06,352
Then what did I just see?
Your mom looks totally fine.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,915
Mom, mom, enough!

4
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:11,300
Mom, the baby is gone.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,460
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,584
Have you seen Tulip? She's in danger!

7
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,888
I'll help look for her too.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm dating Tulip now.
I did everything you told me to.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,440
Now it's time you gave me my reward.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,640
[Two months ago]

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,030
- Khaw.
- Yeah?

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,872
I think I'm in love with you.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,880
Yeah.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,840
That's it? That's all you've got?

15
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,664
What?

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,608
How long do I have to wait?

18
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:00,640
Wait for what?

19
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:05,090
For the day I actually get to be with you.

20
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,496
Do you know why I wanted to study here?

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,280
No.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,960
You said it had to be this place.

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,088
So I followed you. That's it.

24
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:53,144
There's someone here I wanted to find.

25
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:56,600
And I knew they'd definitely study here.

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,792
Don't tell me you already liked someone.
And you followed them here.

27
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:00,920
Then what am I to you?

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,460
No.

29
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,624
She's a girl.

30
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,536
A girl?

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,512
And it's the complete opposite of "like".

32
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,696
What's that supposed to mean?

33
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,032
Do you really love me?

34
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,664
Can you do me a favor?

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,590
Like what?

36
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,784
Go flirt with this girl for me.

37
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,808
Make sure she falls for you.

38
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,810
Desperately in love with you.

39
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,072
Then you dump her.

40
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:13,540
I want her to understand
what losing someone she loves feels like.

41
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,080
What for?

42
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,740
I can't tell you yet.

43
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,136
But if you do it...

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,864
I...

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,408
willl be yours. Forever.

46
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,260
I've done everything you told me to.

47
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,290
You told me to go flirt with Tulip.

48
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,520
Make her like me.

49
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,664
What are you doing all this for?

50
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:29,578
I still can't tell you yet.

51
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,620
So...

52
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,050
How long do I have to pretend I like Tulip?

53
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,896
Until...

54
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,880
Until she really falls for you. Hard.

55
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,160
Like, really hard.

56
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,328
And when that time comes...

57
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,888
you dump her.

58
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,416
Just so you know, everything I'm doing,
it's all for you.

59
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,720
[Wawwa - 2 missed calls]

60
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,480
Hey.

61
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,740
Did the noise wake you up?

62
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,608
No, no.

63
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,960
Why did you get home just now?

64
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,240
Oh. My mom wasn't feeling well last night.

65
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,390
So I kept her company last night.

66
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,080
Is she better now?

67
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,730
Yeah. She's fine now.

68
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,568
I've got a morning class.
I'll go shower first.

69
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:12,400
Hey, wait.

70
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,960
I don't know if you saw my message.

71
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,824
The one where I said I'm dating Tao now.

72
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:20,848
Oh, yeah?

73
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:22,408
He finally found the guts to ask you?

74
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,896
Yeah, I was kinda surprised too.

75
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:27,190
But now that we're actually together

76
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,360
I don't really know how to act.

77
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,928
Don't overthink it.

78
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,376
He's a good guy.

79
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:35,160
And I believe he can take care of you.

80
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
I hope so too.

81
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,970
And whose shirt are you wearing?

82
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,680
It's huge, like a guy's shirt.

83
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,400
It's mine.

84
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,392
I like wearing oversized shirts.
You didn't know?

85
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,176
Hey.

86
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:58,396
Tulip.

87
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:03,848
- Tao, sir!
- What?

88
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,200
Is this your grand opening or what?

89
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,860
Hey, hey! Keep walking. Stop teasing.

90
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,790
Holding hands already.

91
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,928
They're asking for it.

92
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,120
Tulip.

93
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:24,983
When class is over, come find me.

94
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:28,210
What's up?

95
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,696
I've got something to talk to you about.

96
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,840
Just the two of us.

97
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,558
What happened?

98
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,416
Well... last night...

99
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,160
Wawwa! Wawwa!

100
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,950
Did you file a police report yet?

101
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,340
Not yet.

102
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,280
The Professor said
they don't want this blowing up.

103
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,112
Someone literally got attacked.

104
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:19,544
How is that not a big deal?

105
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,920
I'm also waiting for Wawwa
to wake up and fill me in.

106
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,020
So... why were you calling Wawwa last night?

107
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,832
Last night, Wawwa was looking for you.

108
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:34,840
She had something
she wanted to talk to you about.

109
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,160
So I helped her try to find you.

110
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,968
Oh... those missed calls yesterday?

111
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:44,560
Sorry. I was with Tao,
so I didn't get to call back.

112
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,710
It's okay.

113
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,864
Wawwa just found out something.

114
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:53,144
So she wanted to talk to you.

115
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,880
About what?

116
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,100
Baikhaw.

117
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,210
Wawwa said Baikhaw once poisoned a senior
at her old school.

118
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,030
The girl almost died.

119
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,328
What?

120
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,590
If that's really true,

121
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,170
it means you're living with someone who's...

122
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,470
seriously dangerous.

123
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,848
How can you say
that I'm blowing this out of proportion?

124
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:23,288
My daughter almost died!

125
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,870
Isn't that big enough for you?

126
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,280
Ma'am. Is something wrong?

127
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,480
Tulip, this professor won't let me
file a report

128
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,336
because they're afraid
it'll hurt the university's reputation.

129
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:34,768
That's not the reason.

130
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:38,112
We haven't gone to the police
because at the campus,

131
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:42,408
not a single CCTV camera
caught what happened.

132
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,664
None of them?

133
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:45,980
Yes.

134
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,312
Right now, we don't even know for sure

135
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:51,755
that this incident actually
happened the way it seems.

136
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:54,660
What do you mean by that?

137
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,952
Are you saying that Wawwa made this up

138
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:00,488
and injured herself this badly on purpose?

139
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,750
Here, this is Wawwa's bag.

140
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,832
It was found at the scene.

141
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,000
Wawwa.

142
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,800
It's me, Tulip.

143
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,936
Tulip! Why can't I see anything?

144
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:47,704
- What happened to me?
- Calm down, okay?

145
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:51,448
You probably won't be able to see
for a little while.

146
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:55,736
And... is... is anyone else here?

147
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:59,260
No, no. Right now, it's just you and me.

148
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,328
Tulip, it was so really scary.

149
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:02,680
Someone... I don't know who...

150
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,760
Poured some kind of chemical
right onto my eyes.

151
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,630
It burned so much.

152
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,096
And did you see their face at all?

153
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,340
Who was it?

154
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,552
No, nothing. It was so dark.

155
00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:15,912
I...

156
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,340
I think it had to be Baikhaw.

157
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,160
Tulip, I found out

158
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,800
that Baikhaw poisoned a senior
at her old school.

159
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,736
It has to be her.
She must've known I found out.

160
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:28,330
So she came after me and attacked me.

161
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,950
Wawwa.

162
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,264
Let me ask you honestly.

163
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,630
Were you using drugs?

164
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,104
Huh?

165
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,288
What did you just say?

166
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,800
It's just...

167
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,060
The professor found this in the bathroom.

168
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,824
What is it?

169
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,800
Tulip.

170
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,512
I don't even know what that is.

171
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:04,872
But if it's drugs, they're not mine.
You know I don't do drugs.

172
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:06,056
But it was in your bag.

173
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,608
It's not mine!

174
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:09,770
Anyone could've put it there.

175
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,470
Tulip. You have to believe me.

176
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,048
Baikhaw... she must've planted it in my bag.

177
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:16,272
Wawwa. Enough!

178
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,300
This isn't something small anymore.

179
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,952
But it's not mine!

180
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:22,080
I have no idea how it got in my bag.

181
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,960
- Someone's framing me.
- Wawwa.

182
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,512
- Mom? Mom! Help me!
- Dear...

183
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:26,712
The drugs aren't mine.

184
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:28,780
- I'm here, sweetheart.
- Mom, please help me.

185
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,408
Someone attacked me
and planted drugs on me.

186
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:32,968
It wasn't me.

187
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,260
What's this?

188
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,830
Chamomile tea.

189
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,304
It helps you sleep.

190
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,832
Thanks.

191
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:03,760
About Wawwa, don't stress over it.

192
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,128
She brought this on herself.

193
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,448
Yeah...

194
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,300
I just can't stop thinking about it.

195
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,816
What kind of friend am I?

196
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,720
How did I not know she was like this?

197
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,140
Why didn't anything feel off to me?

198
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,560
Hey. You haven't been close for ages.
It's normal.

199
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,864
People grow apart.

200
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,424
You end up knowing them less.

201
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,830
Haven't you heard?
The older you get, the smaller your circle.

202
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,730
I know, but... I just feel guilty.

203
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,030
I couldn't help her at all.

204
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,352
Just the fact that you care...

205
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,376
makes you a damn good friend already.

206
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:50,340
Just help her as much as you can.

207
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,160
Yeah...

208
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,670
But people have their own problems
they need to deal with themselves.

209
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,544
Even you do.

210
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,420
Drink your tea, and get some sleep.

211
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,128
Thanks.

212
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,768
I'm out of my anxiety meds.

213
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:21,300
Guess I'll have to go home and get them.

214
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,744
I really don't want to go home.

215
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,880
I don't want to see my parents.

216
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,320
If you don't wanna go, then don't.

217
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,592
But I'm out of meds.

218
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,320
Honestly, I could just make this tea
for you every day,

219
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,080
and you'd sleep fine.

220
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,190
Seriously,

221
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,024
you go home, they say shitty things to you,

222
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:52,220
and you come back here all upset.

223
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,750
Total waste of your time.

224
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,128
I don't want to go back either.

225
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,258
In that house... well...

226
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,416
no one understands me.

227
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,372
Pick up the phone. We need to talk.

228
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,800
Have you seen this? Season one was insane.

229
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,090
I'm like a hardcore fan.

230
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,360
I watched it ages ago.

231
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,648
I barely remember anything.

232
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:02,450
No worries.
You can ask me if you have any questions.

233
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,152
Popcorn.

234
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,960
Let me feed you. There you go.

235
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,568
Tao.

236
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:25,376
What's wrong, Tulip?

237
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,629
It's just... I...

238
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,144
If you're nervous, it's okay.

239
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:31,580
I brought protection.

240
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,128
No, I just feel like... this is too soon.

241
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,704
Too soon? Tulip. How is it too soon?

242
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:41,710
We've been feeling the same way, haven't we?

243
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,448
You like me too, don't you?

244
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:45,752
I do, but...

245
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,400
Let's not rush.

246
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,430
Tao!

247
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,760
It's fine. Whatever.

248
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,790
So you don't like him or what?

249
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,656
I do like him.

250
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,488
Then why won't you just let him...

251
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,450
Why won't you let him sleep with you?

252
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,860
I just feel like it's a bit too fast.

253
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,050
Oh, come on!

254
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,340
What era are you living in?
You're not even that young.

255
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,920
It's not too fast.

256
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,340
I'm not old-fashioned or anything, but...

257
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,750
I just want a bit more time.

258
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,424
If you're scared,

259
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:40,192
I can go with you to buy condoms, okay?

260
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:41,960
It's not that.

261
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,680
So why are you overthinking everything?

262
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,432
I just don't want you
to end up fighting with him over this.

263
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:52,090
- I've been watching you two...
- Whatever. Forget it.

264
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,380
Anyway, what about the faculty party tonight?

265
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,440
Can't ditch, can I?

266
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,320
Probably not. It's a big event.

267
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,864
Okay. I have to go.

268
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:04,608
- Please take care of the bill for me.
- Yeah, see you.

269
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,376
Scan, please.

270
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,368
All set.

271
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,080
[Mom]

272
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,864
It's not even 9 PM yet.

273
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,320
What's the rush?

274
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,780
Drink fast, get drunk fast,
then go home fast.

275
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,610
Yes, ma'am, queen introvert.

276
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,400
I'm gonna go top up my drink.

277
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,648
Can I get a refill, please?

278
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,760
Tulip.

279
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,776
About yesterday, I'm sorry.

280
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:12,580
I shouldn't have done that to you.

281
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,384
I should've waited
until you were really ready.

282
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,680
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,464
It's okay. I get it.

284
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,790
Don't pressure yourself, Tulip.

285
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,256
I'll wait until you're really ready.

286
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,152
Okay.

287
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,544
Hey, what are you doing?

288
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,552
What's got you so stressed?

289
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,104
I just don't wanna overthink stuff.

290
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,430
What's going on?

291
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,280
Can you tell me?

292
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,608
Namo, have you ever had a girlfriend?

293
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,760
Why?

294
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,230
Just wondering about something.

295
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,240
But never mind. Forget it.

296
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,810
Huh?

297
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,820
Are you teasing me?

298
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,395
Now I wanna know even more.

299
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:28,136
That makes me want to tell you even less.

300
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:30,208
Never mind, girl stuff.

301
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,264
Namo.

302
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,528
Can you help carry the stuff in the back?

303
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,690
All done.

304
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,960
Anything else you need?

305
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,520
No.

306
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,112
You know, right?

307
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,910
Tao and Tulip are dating now.

308
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,180
Yeah, I know.

309
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,152
Okay. Good.

310
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:06,719
But you like Tulip, don't you?

311
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:10,192
Right?

312
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,960
So I want you to leave her alone.

313
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,020
I don't want any trouble.

314
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,408
Hey!

315
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,930
I just want to be her friend.

316
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,248
I'm not trying to cause problems.

317
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:33,744
No.

318
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:40,424
I don't want Tao and Tulip fighting
because of you.

319
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,180
I haven't even done anything.

320
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,704
I'm just worried about Tulip.

321
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:49,860
Good.

322
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,408
Thanks for caring.

323
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,540
But I think Tulip has me as her friend,

324
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,816
and Tao as her boyfriend.

325
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,168
That's enough.

326
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,696
Anything else is unnecessary.

327
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,710
Why aren't you singing?

328
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,528
I'm tired.

329
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:31,710
Not having fun?

330
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,160
I am, but I drank too much. I'm drunk.

331
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,848
Same. I'm drunk too.

332
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,440
- Hey.
- Well, well, well.

333
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
- So sweet, you two.
- Can we steal you away

334
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,210
from your sweetheart for a sec, Tulip?

335
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,608
Go sing for us.

336
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:54,920
Please?

337
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,136
No, I don't want to.

338
00:24:56,136 --> 00:24:57,864
Just a little bit!

339
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,688
Come on. Sing for us.

340
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:01,024
I wanna hear that pretty voice.

341
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:02,936
I'm tired of hearing this one sing.

342
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:03,944
Please?

343
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:05,440
No, I'm drunk already.

344
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,329
Hey, guys! Anyone wanna hear Tulip sing?
Let me hear you!

345
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:22,120
Tulip! Tulip! Tulip!

346
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,862
Sing with me!

347
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,680
Cheers!

348
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,360
Give her a big hand!

349
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,664
- That was amazing!
- So good. So, so good.

350
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:18,376
Can I toast with the singer?

351
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,632
Cheers!

352
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,180
Half a glass.

353
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,488
- Half!?
- For you, yeah.

354
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:26,792
Your voice is seriously beautiful.

355
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:29,728
If my friend sang, it'd be amazing too.

356
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,104
Amazingly bad.

357
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,296
Also a faculty Princess.

358
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:41,408
Dang!

359
00:26:42,624 --> 00:26:44,384
They want to clink your glass.

360
00:26:44,384 --> 00:26:45,768
You trying to get me drunk?

361
00:26:45,768 --> 00:26:49,140
Come on, come on, yeah!

362
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,152
Half a glass.

363
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,456
What's wrong now?

364
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,288
Tulip told me
that you tried to sleep with her.

365
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,493
And what about it?

366
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,184
Did you really need to go that far?

367
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,128
Aren't you the one who told me to do it?

368
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,264
Yeah, but...

369
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,220
- What, are you jealous?
- No, I'm not jealous.

370
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,960
Then what's your problem?

371
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,656
You act like if I actually fell for Tulip,
you'd suddenly date me for real.

372
00:27:40,656 --> 00:27:44,024
- You idiot, you're drunk.
- Drunk, my ass.

373
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,740
Tao!

374
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,060
People will see. Stop.

375
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,488
Fine.

376
00:27:49,488 --> 00:27:51,512
I'll just go screw Tulip
and get this over with.

377
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:54,290
Then this shitty deal between us
can finally end.

378
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,580
Come on, step by step.

379
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,714
- Easy, careful.
- Where are we going?

380
00:28:14,714 --> 00:28:16,560
Everyone's gone home already.

381
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,376
I don't wanna go home yet.

382
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:23,024
Well, you're already home, so...

383
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:24,688
She smells so bad.

384
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:27,760
Oh damn, don't cover her. She reeks.

385
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,152
Do you wanna shower?

386
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,288
Is she up for it?

387
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:46,680
You know what? I love you two the most.

388
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:52,330
- Yeah, yeah.
- One of you is my boyfriend.

389
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,760
And the other is my best friend.

390
00:28:58,648 --> 00:29:02,056
I'll let you sleep, Tulip. I'll head out now.

391
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,540
Oh, Namo.

392
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,910
Don't be mad. I love you too.

393
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,750
Don't need to get all touchy.

394
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,168
I'm not offended.

395
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:16,840
You're an important friend to me.

396
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,260
I care about you too.

397
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,224
And I won't let anyone hurt you.

398
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,128
Thank you.

399
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,192
I love you guys so much.

400
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,688
I love you all.

401
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,088
Namo, you go and head back first.

402
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:44,860
I'll stay and keep an eye on Tulip for a bit.

403
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,670
Baikhaw's here too.

404
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,040
Yeah, I know, but...

405
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,152
In case Tulip wakes up
while Baikhaw's asleep or something.

406
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,776
Just go ahead, okay?

407
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,500
I'll head back on my own later.

408
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,216
Okay.

409
00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:00,304
- See you.
- Yeah.

410
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,520
Besides my mom,
you're the only one who's ever bathed me.

411
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,416
How could I not?
You smelled like puke. So bad.

412
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,992
Thank you for everything.

413
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,944
You're so damn good to me.

414
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,336
You're like the big sister
I've always wanted.

415
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,408
Sometimes I think that too.

416
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,288
Hey...

417
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,096
About Tao...

418
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,128
I think I'm okay now.

419
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,200
About what?

420
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,056
Like...

421
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:12,060
I'm ready to move forward with him.

422
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,648
Are you sure?

423
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,500
Yeah.

424
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,712
I'm okay now.

425
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,416
I feel like I'm falling more and more
in love with him.

426
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,680
My head hurts.

427
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,880
Is Tulip asleep?

428
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,700
Yeah.

429
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,656
What are you waiting for?

430
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,680
We're not done talking.

431
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,040
So tell me.

432
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,592
What exactly do you want me to do with Tulip?

433
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,280
Just keep doing what you've been doing.

434
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,800
Even if I sleep with her,
you don't feel anything?

435
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,000
Do you even have any feelings for me at all?

436
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,240
What are you talking about?

437
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,264
I've done all this for you,

438
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:40,528
and you still can't give me an answer?

439
00:33:41,224 --> 00:33:44,020
Sometimes you act like
you don't care about me.

440
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,490
And sometimes you act like
you don't want me to move on.

441
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,544
Are you keeping me around because
all you want is to sleep with me?

442
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:52,336
I don't want to talk about this.

443
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:55,688
Or you're keeping me around just to use me.

444
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,728
No matter how much I do for you,
you'll never see me as anything more.

445
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:03,100
- Are you drunk or what?
- I'm not drunk.

446
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,704
I think about this all the time.

447
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:07,470
I just never said it.

448
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,016
Baikhaw.

449
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,192
I'm done letting you use me.

450
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,160
What the hell is wrong with you?

451
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,648
Baikhaw...

452
00:35:59,264 --> 00:36:01,024
Baikhaw!

453
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,192
Why are you sleeping out here?

454
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,880
Why is the room such a mess?

455
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,360
I'm drunk as hell.

456
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,320
Whoa!

457
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,648
Are you naked?

458
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,696
I... I was hot.

459
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,800
Are you okay?

460
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,710
You're even more wasted than I am.

461
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,912
Come on, go to bed properly.

462
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,780
You were that hot
you had to take your underwear off?

463
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,656
No, I needed to pee.

464
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:56,488
I was probably drunk and just took it off.

465
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:59,112
Okay, okay. Be careful.

466
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,820
Namo.

467
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,880
What are you doing standing here alone?

468
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,270
Tulip.

469
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,272
Are you free this evening?

470
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,470
Why?

471
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,940
I wanna talk to you about something.

472
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,136
This evening...

473
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,472
I actually already have plans with Baikhaw.

474
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,296
Oh, okay.

475
00:37:58,296 --> 00:38:00,088
We can talk later.

476
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:01,300
Come on, let's go.

477
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,904
See you.

478
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,464
I already told you.
I checked everything that night.

479
00:38:09,464 --> 00:38:11,912
There's no footage of an attacker
like you said.

480
00:38:16,965 --> 00:38:19,872
Maybe you could look a little harder?

481
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,008
Fine. I'll take another look for you.

482
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,160
W-Wait, stop right here.

483
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,790
Can you zoom in?

484
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,824
Zoom more... more...

485
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,790
What does Namo want to talk to you about?

486
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,616
I have no idea.

487
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:05,160
But he's been acting weird

488
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,920
ever since the night Wawwa got attacked.

489
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,990
- Really?
- Yeah.

490
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,296
- Baikhaw!
- What the hell is wrong with you now?

491
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:14,910
- I know you're the one who did that to me.
- Wawwa!

492
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,912
Tulip. Look at this.

493
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:18,550
I have a clip.

494
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,690
Here.

495
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,010
This is the night before I got attacked.

496
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,688
She's right there in the footage.
Don't you think that's way too convenient?

497
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:29,120
This is my campus.
I'm allowed to go wherever I want.

498
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,660
Stop bullshitting.

499
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,120
You planted drugs on me.

500
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,990
You ruined my future.

501
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,980
I know you're not sincere with Tulip.

502
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,568
And that senior, Q...

503
00:39:38,568 --> 00:39:39,960
The girl who almost slept with him
in his car?

504
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,576
That was you.

505
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,896
- Just stop lying...
- You're the liar.

506
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,440
I know everything now. It's you!

507
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,780
Everything you're saying?
You're the one who did it.

508
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,528
- What did I do?
- Wanna see yourself?

509
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:52,912
- Show me then.
- Fine. I'll show you.

510
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:54,860
Bring it.

511
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,920
What are you trying to do?

512
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,584
Watch it yourself.

513
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,880
Do you really like my friend?

514
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,472
Yeah, I do.

515
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,550
What about me? Do you like me?

516
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,140
You're the one who told me.

517
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,744
That with you, it's just for fun.

518
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,592
Tulip, it... it's not like that, okay?

519
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:27,448
Honestly, I didn't even want to say anything
at first.

520
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:30,160
But you were so damn annoying,
always picking fights with me.

521
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,775
So yeah, I had to say it.

522
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:33,280
I was just drunk that night.

523
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,470
Are you sure it was just once?

524
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,864
- Baikhaw!
- Wawwa!

525
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,120
Fine! I liked Q.

526
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,470
And we slept together.

527
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,000
But...

528
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,520
I knew Q wanted to date you.

529
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,760
And he would never actually date me anyway.

530
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,120
So I backed off.

531
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,128
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

532
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:00,728
I wanted you to be happy.

533
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:02,216
And I wanted Q to be happy too.

534
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:04,760
Wow... Miss Goody two-shoes.

535
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,688
So you let your friend take
whatever scraps were left over after you.

536
00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:09,670
No! I never thought of it like that.

537
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,512
- Or you just wanted to win...
- No!

538
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:13,140
Oh? Then what?

539
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,180
- I just wanted you to be happy.
- Really?

540
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,368
If your life's a mess, fine.
Be a mess by yourself.

541
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:22,540
Why drag your friend down with you?

542
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,536
And look, I'm not even trying to be mean,
but people like you...

543
00:41:26,536 --> 00:41:29,340
You don't deserve to be her friend.

544
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,620
Tulip, please, listen to me.

545
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,544
I was wrong about this, yes.

546
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:39,456
But... about Baikhaw, she hurt me.

547
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,048
She's ly...

548
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,920
Stop talking!

549
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,872
This whole time, I've always defended you.

550
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,944
But today, I think I'm done.

551
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,464
Come on, let's go.

552
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,840
Tulip!

553
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,260
Tulip!

554
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,360
Tulip!

555
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,888
Tulip!

556
00:42:12,888 --> 00:42:15,610
- Tulip!
- No more Tulip for you.

557
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,424
Tulip!

558
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,160
I never thought
things would turn out like this.

559
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,000
We were so close, you know?

560
00:42:30,736 --> 00:42:33,540
I trusted everything she ever said.

561
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,168
Why would she do this to me?

562
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,890
Why did she have to lie to me?

563
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:44,064
Don't cry. What are you crying for?

564
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,560
I feel like I don't have anyone left.

565
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,184
I just have you.

566
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,688
You're my only real friend.

567
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:13,420
From now on, whatever happens, just tell me.

568
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,420
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

569
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,410
Tough day today.

570
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,900
I just realized something.

571
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,072
When you cut off a friend you've had forever,

572
00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:45,096
this is what it feels like.

573
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,760
All this time,

574
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,680
I always believed that
if you're real with someone,

575
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,320
they'll be real with you.

576
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:08,140
But now I'm not so sure anymore.

577
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:20,344
I'm really glad
that I have you and Baikhaw with me now.

578
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,456
If I didn't have you two,

579
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:29,260
I think I'd be way worse off.

580
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:35,820
With everything, my parents... my friend...

581
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,016
Especially when it's my close friend.

582
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,416
I don't even know how I'd get through it.

583
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,720
- Dad!
- It's late. What took you so long?

584
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,704
I was studying with my friends.

585
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,900
Are you sure you weren't with some boy?

586
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,496
Seriously, what are you doing here?

587
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:46,960
Why are you picking a fight with me?

588
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,888
I've tried calling you every day.
You never pick up.

589
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:51,980
Why would you do this to me?

590
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,592
Stop lying, Dad.

591
00:45:53,592 --> 00:45:56,360
You never called me. Not once.

592
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:06,400
That's not true.

593
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,928
I never got a single missed call.

594
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,168
Wait, your number's blocked... but...

595
00:46:19,352 --> 00:46:21,180
You'd go this far?

596
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,400
- I'm your father!
- I told you I didn't block you!

597
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Maybe I pressed it by accident!

598
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,921
What the hell...

599
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:30,600
If you don't even respect me,
then fine. We're done.

600
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,680
Let's see how you survive without me.

601
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,080
Baikhaw...

602
00:47:01,432 --> 00:47:04,230
I don't want to hurt Tulip anymore.

603
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,780
I can't. I can't just sleep with her.

604
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:44,150
Nail her and we'll be together.

605
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:47,952
Baikhaw and Tao, they are more than friends.

606
00:47:49,528 --> 00:47:51,380
Tulip!

607
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,064
Hello, Namo.

608
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,696
Namo!
