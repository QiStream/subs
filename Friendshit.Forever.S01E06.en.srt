1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,592
Are you okay?

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,320
I'm so scared he'd die.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,896
You're so scary right now.

4
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:08,168
You lied to Tulip and everyone
as if nothing happened.

5
00:00:08,168 --> 00:00:11,048
I'm scared that the more I get to know you,
understand you,

6
00:00:11,048 --> 00:00:13,310
it would only mean
that I'm an asshole just like you.

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,990
It's like they totally cut me off.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,808
I honestly have no one left.

9
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:20,784
Will you wait for me here? I'll be back.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,708
Baikhaw and Tao...

11
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,096
they are more than just friends.

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,920
Listen to me.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,376
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

14
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:07,410
Whatever you're about to say is all lies.

15
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,736
Just shut your mouth.

16
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,616
No, please! Let me explain.

17
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:12,336
What is there to explain?

18
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:14,080
How could you two do this to me?

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,480
You're my friend.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,648
And you're my boyfriend.

21
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,240
The two of you are absolutely cold-blooded.

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,560
No, I didn't mean for you
to see something this messed up.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,088
Yeah, of course you didn't mean to.

24
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:28,216
- Please let me explain.
- You don't need to explain anything.

25
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:29,776
You never meant any of it anyway.

26
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:30,888
How could you mean it?

27
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:33,380
If you did, how would you keep lying to me?

28
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,888
How else would you keep the lie going?

29
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,660
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm sorry. Let me explain, please.

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,272
I swear I have my reasons.

32
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,740
What sick reasons could you possibly have?

33
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,672
Except wanting to keep me
looking like an idiot.

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,952
You guys are just...

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,144
so damn good at this.

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,740
You made sure I had no one left.

37
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,540
In the end, all I had was you two,
and you stabbed me in the back.

38
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,160
How could you do this?

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,152
Did I ever do anything to you?

40
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,800
Did I ever hurt you? Answer me!

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,590
You never did anything to me.

42
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,848
You never did anything to any of us.

43
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:19,896
- Really.
- Then why the hell did you do this?

44
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:23,648
No, I'm sorry. I really do love you.

45
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:25,936
- I actually want to protect you.
- Protect me?

46
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:27,712
- I really love you.
- What the hell are you talking about?

47
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,224
I really love you.

48
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:38,624
Tulip. Please listen to me.

50
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:40,400
- Listen to what?
- No, no...

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,040
Your words don't mean shit to me anymore.

52
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,176
Please! Let me explain!

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,712
I don't have anyone left.

54
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,976
I just have you.

55
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:57,300
From now on, whatever happens, just tell me.

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,624
I love you guys so much.

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,120
I love all of you.

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,936
I'm not going to stoop as low as you.

59
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,140
Tulip!

60
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,520
Tulip, wait for me! Tulip!

61
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,620
Tulip.

62
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,920
Tulip. Tulip, wait.

63
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
Let go.

64
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,180
Tulip. I'm sorry.

65
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,544
But what I feel for you... it's real.

66
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,512
You think saying all this now
is going to make me believe you?

67
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,760
How many things have you lied to me about?

68
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,944
I know whatever I say now
will just sound like excuses.

69
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,528
But the feelings I have for you...

70
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,392
have grown more and more.

71
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,560
I really do love you, Tulip.

72
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,768
I want to protect you.

73
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:22,992
I want to take care of you.
I want to be by your side.

74
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,712
I don't want to lose you.

75
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,696
Can you give me another chance?

77
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:59,302
Please give me a chance.

78
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,240
Just now you said...

79
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,112
that you love me...

80
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,120
that you don't want to lose me, right?

81
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,232
I really don't.

82
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,048
Good.

83
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,000
Then you'll understand...

84
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:43,526
what it feels like to lose someone you love.

85
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,048
How painful it is.

86
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:12,140
Every time you look at me...

87
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,232
I want you to feel sadness...

88
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,696
regret...

89
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,672
and longing for what you lost.

90
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,792
Because from now on,

91
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:33,290
you will never get me back.

92
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,100
I'm really sorry for not trusting you
from the start.

93
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm sorry for everything.

94
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,120
Baikhaw did a number on you.

95
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,168
I don't blame you.

96
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,464
But I really don't understand.

97
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:44,770
Why would she do something like that to me?

98
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,784
She's just a shitty person.

99
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:50,300
For real. Don't waste your time
trying to figure her out.

100
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,640
You'll never understand her.

101
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,824
You're not like her.

102
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,750
So now, what are you going to do next?

103
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,296
Everything's ruined.

104
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,736
Tulip is never going to forgive me.

105
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:23,176
And what did you do to get caught?

106
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,096
Oh, so now you're blaming everyone
but yourself.

107
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,272
You're the one who made everything
blow up like this.

108
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:32,130
You're the idiot who didn't follow
what I told you.

109
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,632
You just had to go and fall for her.
And that's why everything's a mess now.

110
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:36,688
- Baikhaw!
- What?

111
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Someone like you deserves to end up alone.

112
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,808
If you walk away from me...

113
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,390
If I blab about what happened with Namo,

114
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,328
you're done for.

115
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,128
Take these out.

116
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:11,360
If not,
I'll have someone throw everything out.

117
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,780
- Let me talk to Tulip.
- No!

118
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,168
I told you.
Tulip can't go on with her life without me.

119
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:19,600
You're the one who's hurt Tulip the most.

120
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,440
No, it's you!

121
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,512
You believe your husband over your own child.

122
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:24,672
When she needed you most, where were you?

123
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:26,600
- And what business is that of yours?
- Where were you?

124
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,248
- You can't go inside.
- I'm going in.

125
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,094
What the hell are you doing here?

126
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:34,104
Please just listen.
Let me explain one more time.

127
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,640
What's left for me to listen to?

128
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,032
After everything that's happened,
you still think I'm not stupid enough?

129
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:41,904
- No, I've never thought you were stupid.
- Then have you ever seen me as a friend?

130
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,760
Think about it carefully.

131
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,320
If you don't have me...

132
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,660
Everyone around you is trash, you know that.

133
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,576
Around me, you're the worst of all.

134
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,384
Fine. I wanna see...

135
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:25,930
how long you can keep this up.

136
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,080
Because without me...

137
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,248
If you don't have me...

138
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,336
You'll end up with no one either.

139
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,976
You'll have absolutely no one.

140
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm sorry, Mom.

141
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,184
I didn't trust you from the beginning.

142
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,392
It's alright, sweetheart.

143
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,870
She's just one bad person in your life.

144
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,300
From now on,

145
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,392
you need to trust what Dad and I tell you.

146
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:34,344
Your father and I
have seen more of the world.

147
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:37,464
We can tell who's good and who's not.

148
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,984
It's good, actually.

149
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,776
We can go back to being a family like before.

150
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,232
And there's something else
I want to tell you.

151
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,020
That time,

152
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,648
the person who brought me
the clip of you and Tao...

153
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,592
was Baikhaw.

154
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,672
Hey, look!

155
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,384
- What?
- Whoa, what clip is that?

156
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:29,520
- Who's that?
- Dude, record it, record it!

157
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,856
Wow, no shame at all.

158
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,510
Hey! Who played this video?

159
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,960
I don't know, Professor.

160
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,792
It just started playing by itself.

161
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:41,456
Brazen.

162
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,000
How could they?

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,848
Like they have no shame at all.

164
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,288
Their poor parents.

165
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,464
She looks exactly like the girl in the clip.

166
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:56,920
She does.

167
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,024
I think it's her.

168
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:04,500
Doing those positions and everything.

169
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,496
Does she have any shame?

170
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,624
Crisp and clear, 4k quality.

171
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,000
[Leaked sex tape shown in top university library
causes scandal]

172
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,850
Do you think what I did was too much?

173
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,744
Compared to what she did to you and to me?

174
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:57,690
Not at all.

175
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,540
But I don't feel satisfied or anything.

176
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,456
You're just too nice.

177
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:04,180
That's why someone like her
managed to fool you.

178
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,020
But what I'm doing...

179
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,456
Isn't it just as awful as what she did?

180
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,460
Hey.

181
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,730
Someone like her deserves it.

182
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,100
Stop overthinking it.

183
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,744
Now everyone can see her true colors.

184
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,350
So no one else ends up being her victim.

185
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,688
This video is yours, isn't it?

186
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,610
Yes, Professor.

187
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,770
To be honest, you've been having problems
since the start of the semester.

188
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,392
All of us know you
as a capable and diligent student.

189
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:45,130
So we've tried to protect you
so you wouldn't lose your scholarship.

190
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,048
But with a scandal of this magnitude,

191
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:51,910
I don't think we can help you this time.

192
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,688
Professor, I wasn't the one
who leaked the video.

193
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:55,968
I'm the victim here.

194
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:57,760
But it's brought disrepute to the university.

195
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,856
How will you take responsibility?

196
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,288
I didn't do anything wrong, Professor.

197
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:04,520
How am I supposed to take responsibility?

198
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,536
The university has no obligation
to keep providing a scholarship

199
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:10,496
to someone whose actions
have caused trouble for the institution.

200
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,360
Just focus on your studies
and pay more attention to your academic work.

201
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,640
And don't cause any more trouble.

202
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,240
Yes, Professor.

203
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,208
Namo.

204
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,424
You being here like this...
Was it because of Baikhaw?

205
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,264
Hurry and wake up soon, okay?

206
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,808
So you can tell everyone the truth

207
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:44,850
about what really happened that night.

208
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,150
The baby...

209
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,208
Where is she?

210
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,200
Mom, go upstairs and rest.
I'll clean this up.

211
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,960
The baby didn't come with you?

212
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,808
- Huh?
- Not today, Mom. Go upstairs.

213
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:41,472
But she hasn't come home in days.

214
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:44,080
- I miss her.
- That's enough, Mom. Go, please.

215
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,104
Where is the baby?

216
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:50,300
Mom, I'm exhausted today. I'm begging you.

217
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,780
Stop!

218
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,864
Mom! Go to bed.

219
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:54,120
- The baby...
- Mom, go to bed.

220
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,304
- I want the baby.
- Mom, she died!

221
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,168
No.

222
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:01,540
That's not true.

223
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,848
See? That's Daddy.

224
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,432
The baby went on a trip with Daddy.

225
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:08,672
Get Daddy.

226
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:11,728
Mom, Dad is dead too!

227
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,390
No!

228
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,168
Mom, go upstairs.

229
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:18,960
No!

230
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,368
Mom, stop!

231
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:37,290
When I'm with you, I feel like...

232
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,792
we're sisters or something.

233
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:54,100
The baby isn't dead.

234
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,650
The baby isn't dead.

235
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,280
The baby isn't dead.

236
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,072
Where is she?

237
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,848
Tulip, Tulip, Tulip!

238
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:41,100
Tao, just go home.

239
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,870
Tulip, please don't go yet.

240
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,096
Can I talk to you for just a moment?

241
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,260
I used to be in love with Baikhaw.

242
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,696
So much that whatever she asked me to do,
I did it...

243
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,496
including flirting with you.

244
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,920
At first, I admit...

245
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,720
I didn't really feel that much for you yet.

246
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:12,968
But the closer I got to you...

247
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,400
I started realizing...

248
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,160
that you're genuinely kind.

249
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,720
I really don't want to lose you.

250
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:32,696
If you're angry or hate me,
I understand all of it.

251
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:41,008
But I want you to know
what I feel for you is real.

252
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,250
I truly love you.

253
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,770
That's enough.

254
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,460
Tulip, don't listen to him.

255
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,368
Wawwa, can I talk to Tulip first?

256
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:52,840
Talk or lie again?

257
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,288
Someone like him
can do or say whatever he wants.

258
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:58,680
Remember when he spiked my drink?

259
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,376
I only did that because Baikhaw told me to.

260
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:03,700
I'm sorry.

261
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,232
Your sorry doesn't fix anything.

262
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:07,232
Do you even know what I had to deal with
because of you?

263
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:08,880
Tulip, don't listen to him.

264
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,424
He and Baikhaw are liars, just the same.

265
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:14,030
Tulip, that's not true.

266
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:18,030
I don't even know
what I can trust from you anymore.

267
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:22,750
You say you love me
while you were still with Baikhaw.

268
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,272
You've been lying to me all along.

269
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:25,704
To everyone.

270
00:22:25,704 --> 00:22:27,730
To yourself.

271
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,850
But I don't feel anything
for Baikhaw anymore.

272
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,640
I even hate myself for scheming with her.

273
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:43,260
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm in pain. I can't live without you.

274
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,256
What you feel isn't even half
of what I've been through.

275
00:22:47,256 --> 00:22:49,840
Tulip, can you forgive me?

276
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,016
I'm begging you, Tulip.

277
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,080
Please.

278
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,650
I don't think I can ever forgive you.

279
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,850
Go home.

280
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,432
Don't make me hate you
more than I already do.

281
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,800
Let's go.

282
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,550
Look who it is.

283
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,088
The famous Baikhaw.

284
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,224
Why so stuck-up?

285
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,860
Right now, aside from me,

286
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,952
nobody else wants you anymore.

287
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,360
I watched your clip today.

288
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,312
I was so turned on.

289
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,352
Let me ask you something, seriously.

290
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,712
What part of Tao is hotter than me?

291
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,210
Why'd you sleep with him,

292
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,568
but not once with me?

293
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,056
I'm sure of one thing, though.

294
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,920
I'm way better in bed than he is.

295
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,064
Wanna try?

296
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,032
Can I?

297
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,944
Go on.

298
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,930
Ow!

299
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,260
You filthy creep! So annoying.

300
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,392
You bitch.

301
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,720
Get over here.

302
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,928
I'd never sleep with trash like you,
you piece of shit.

303
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:36,650
I wouldn't want a bitch like you either.

304
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,000
Sluts like you, one time and I'd be bored.

305
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,960
Ow, shit!

306
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,900
Why are you acting so hard to get?

307
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,976
I know you want it.

308
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,840
Come here.

309
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,608
Get over here.

310
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:04,248
You bastard!

311
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,940
Bitch!

312
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,448
You want it rough?

313
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,160
This is what you want, right?

314
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,264
You like this, right?

315
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,896
Like this?

316
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,312
This is for me.

317
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,576
And this is for my sister.

318
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,688
Go screw yourself in hell, you piece of shit.

319
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:19,824
What's going on?

320
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,770
Thanks for coming.

321
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,050
Otherwise I would've caved for sure.

322
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,536
Good thing I got there in time.

323
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,272
Thank you so much.

324
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,640
And... sorry for everything before.

325
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,270
You've apologized to me like a hundred times.

326
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,470
No more apologies, okay?

327
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,130
When Baikhaw hurt me,
you took care of me too.

328
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,340
So don't feel guilty.

329
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,768
And don't feel like you're bothering me.

330
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:35,272
Alright?

331
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,790
Yeah.

332
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,152
Get some sleep.

333
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:41,160
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

334
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,304
If Tao or Baikhaw try to ambush you again,

335
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:45,544
I'll chase them all off.

336
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,088
Okay.

337
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,848
I'm heading out.

338
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,320
- Wawwa.
- Hm?

339
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,480
Hey...

340
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,720
Do you know how to sing a lullaby?

341
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,784
What?

342
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:14,270
Never mind. Go on.

343
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,700
See you tomorrow.

344
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,080
Okay, good night. Bye.

345
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,020
Dad, can I come see you tomorrow?

346
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,196
There's something I need to tell you.

347
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:29,224
I need to talk to you. Come out and meet me.

348
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,390
I'm sorry,
I couldn't get a single taxi to stop.

349
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,016
It's alright. I can walk home.

350
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:45,344
But it's really dark right now.

351
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:48,140
My place is close by. Thank you.

352
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,744
I managed to get rid of you.

353
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,992
Why the hell did you come back?

354
00:35:56,992 --> 00:35:58,710
Can we just talk first?

355
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,752
I don't want to talk to you.

356
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:07,740
I slapped you, beat you,
put you in the hospital.

357
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,770
And you still didn't learn?

358
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,860
So it was you.

359
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,928
Because you stole Tulip away from me.

360
00:36:13,928 --> 00:36:15,216
I didn't steal anyone.

361
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:16,832
Tulip and I have been friends for ages.

362
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:18,990
Friends, my ass.

363
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,512
Friends don't let guys screw their friend.

364
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,420
Leave me alone.

365
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,856
Tulip isn't going back to you.

366
00:36:26,856 --> 00:36:29,768
She won't because of you!

367
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,060
Come back here, you bitch.

368
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,920
Let go! Help!

369
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,376
Let me go!

370
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:11,970
I'll give you this, though.

371
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,632
You're tough as hell.

372
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,340
Thanks for this.

373
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:26,680
Tulip will come back to me
at the cost of your life.

374
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,680
Thanks for showing up just in time
to help me out.

375
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,272
Baikhaw?

376
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,768
- Baikhaw, is that you?
- Tao!

377
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:30,752
Tao, call an ambulance! Hurry!

378
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:33,912
- What happened?
- Call an ambulance right now!

379
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:37,130
- Help me!
- What the hell?

380
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,780
Is this Wawwa?

381
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,680
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

382
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,488
Okay, okay.

383
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,080
Tao, how's Wawwa?

384
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,880
Answer me, Tao. How is Wawwa?

385
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,104
Tulip...

386
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,256
Wawwa's gone.

387
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,632
When I got there,
she had already lost a critical amount of blood.

388
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,672
How could this even happen?

389
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,889
I don't know.

390
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:31,440
The only person who knows is Baikhaw.

391
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,088
I had arranged to meet Tao,

392
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:37,336
and I was walking past the garden.

393
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:40,136
I heard a woman scream,
but I didn't know who it was.

394
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:43,088
When I went in to look,
it turned out to be Wawwa.

395
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:47,590
And I don't know
who the guy running away was.

396
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:51,056
Did you take your friend's phone or bag?

397
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,580
No, I didn't take anything.

398
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,290
Then could they have been left
somewhere at the scene?

399
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,840
I'm not sure.

400
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,550
I didn't see anything there.
Why does it matter?

401
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,688
The victim's phone, bag, and valuables
are missing.

402
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:06,784
It's possible the perpetrator took them.

403
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:09,580
That could make this a robbery-homicide.

404
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,270
But this is only an initial assumption.

405
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,070
We'll still need to proceed
with a full investigation.

406
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,570
Please come in to give a formal statement.

407
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,096
Okay.

408
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,232
I can't help anyone.

409
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,520
Namo, Wawwa...
Both of them almost died right in front of me.

410
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,504
Don't blame yourself like that.

411
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:10,220
It's not your fault.

412
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,360
I know.
It's not like I liked her or anything.

413
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,976
But seeing her like that... I can't take it.

414
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,259
Honestly...

415
00:41:34,303 --> 00:41:36,544
I think this is my fault.

416
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,024
I shouldn't have asked her to stay with me.

417
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,930
If she hadn't come to see me,

418
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:47,620
none of this shit would've happened.

419
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,544
It's not your fault.

420
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,912
It's on me.

421
00:41:51,912 --> 00:41:55,752
Because of me,
you invited her to keep you company.

422
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,264
No, it's me. I'm the one at fault.

423
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,336
The police said Baikhaw is still in shock,

424
00:42:13,336 --> 00:42:15,370
so they let her go home for now.

425
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,712
She can give her statement another day.

426
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:23,624
Aren't you going home?

427
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,260
I'm okay, really.

428
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,176
I'm planning to stop by the station
to give my statement first.

429
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,696
Okay. I'll take care of Baikhaw then.

430
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,144
Tulip...

431
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,048
What is it?

432
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,408
Let's talk later.

433
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,600
Same tea as before...

434
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,608
so you can sleep.

435
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,592
I don't think I'll be able to sleep anyway.

436
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:39,280
Thanks... for talking to me again.

437
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,360
Yeah.

438
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:55,016
I'm really glad we're talking again.

439
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,456
Wawwa really didn't deserve what happened.

440
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,512
Anyone who could do that to her...

441
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,944
isn't human.

442
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,600
Yeah.

443
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,984
Don't think too much about it.

444
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,667
Drink this.

445
00:44:34,156 --> 00:44:36,168
Then get some sleep.

446
00:44:38,688 --> 00:44:40,248
Okay.

447
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,440
[Emergency call]
[Power off]

448
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,030
The only CCTV cameras are
at the park entrance and exit.

449
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,384
I've already checked them.

450
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:29,888
No one entered the park
as that young woman claimed,

451
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:33,420
except for this person, Tao.

452
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,660
Or maybe the perpetrator entered earlier
and hid inside the park for a long time.

453
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:42,824
But there's no footage
of anyone running out either.

454
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,460
Do you know this person?

455
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,448
Baikhaw?

456
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:16,384
I was thinking of inviting you
over to my place.

457
00:48:16,384 --> 00:48:18,320
Sure.

458
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,110
Where is my baby?

459
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,688
There she is, Mom.

460
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,712
You're not my child!
Get out! You're not my child!

461
00:48:30,014 --> 00:48:32,810
Why are you collecting news about my parents?
