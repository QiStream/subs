1
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,908
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,452
PANORAMIC SHOT, JUDGE

3
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,537
DAEHAN CENTRAL PARTY, CHO HU-HEON

4
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:42,750
SUPREME COURT, KIM JUN-MAN

5
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,253
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

6
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,588
Who brought this here?

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,132
You know the old lady who collects scraps.

8
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:51,550
The one you met last time.

9
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:54,428
This was in the pile of scraps
she brought.

10
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,931
Don't tell anyone
you found this in the scraps.

11
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,309
Don't even think about it.
Just forget it, okay?

12
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:02,394
Is this

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,313
that dangerous?

14
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:05,647
I'm getting a bit scared.

15
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,191
Should I have just thrown it away?

16
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,026
No.

17
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,111
I'm just being careful. Don't worry.

18
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,446
I'll take care of it.

19
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:13,864
Han-young

20
00:01:14,364 --> 00:01:15,616
you're really okay, right?

21
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:16,909
Of course.

22
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:20,746
It's only a mother's duty

23
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:24,541
to let people beat her
when her son has done wrong.

24
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:29,254
I won't put you to shame again.

25
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:33,759
EPISODE 5

26
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:36,428
Oh gosh, what's all this?

27
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,901
Would you like me to help you?

28
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:53,529
Oh.

29
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,405
I'm fine.

30
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:59,159
Oh, goodness.

31
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:01,829
Thank you so much.

32
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:04,665
Ma'am.

33
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,917
By any chance...

34
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,088
This won't open.

35
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:12,464
Here. I'll hold it for you.

36
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:13,966
It's too worn out.

37
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,218
It's so worn out
that the seams are coming off.

38
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,344
It's still fine to use.

39
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,097
Get yourself a nicer one.

40
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:21,598
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

41
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:23,517
- Alright, Ms. Shin.
- Okay.

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,601
You have a customer.

43
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:26,228
- Hey!
- I don't have much today.

44
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,521
- He's my son.
- He's handsome.

45
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:28,689
I found the account book.

46
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:30,107
Okay!

47
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,859
I also got the remaining guys.

48
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:34,653
Someone tied them up
at Open Sesame's house.

49
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,281
I'm sure
Director Lee Chang-hyo is behind it.

50
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:38,907
Hey

51
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:41,243
what's the deal about this book, anyway?

52
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:42,995
It's a list of men
exempted from the military

53
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:44,830
using Director Lee's false diagnoses.

54
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:48,375
Damn, the world really hasn't changed,
has it?

55
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,503
Back in our days,
people used their parents' connections

56
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:52,796
to be exempted or to have it easy.

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,881
But

58
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:56,884
why do they have a whole book
that proves their crimes?

59
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,719
Because bad guys don't trust anyone.

60
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:00,512
They think everyone's like them.

61
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:03,557
So, they do whatever they can
to have one on others

62
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,392
without realizing it can hurt them, too.

63
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:09,021
Turn them into the police and go home.

64
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:10,898
I have something else to do first.

65
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,650
THEFT AT GANGCHEON PALACE

66
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,235
GUITAR ANTI-THEFT LOCK GAINS POPULARITY

67
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:17,613
What?

68
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,533
They didn't even report to the cops
before framing my dad?

69
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:26,496
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

70
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:27,998
Yes, Mr. Lee.

71
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:29,666
You called at the perfect time.

72
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,751
Sorry?

73
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,837
Gangcheon Palace didn't even report
the theft case.

74
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:35,505
After framing my dad like that!

75
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,049
That's suspicious, isn't it?

76
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:39,259
You're right. Where are you now?

77
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,553
At a cafe near my office.

78
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,805
Are you in Seoul?

79
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:45,349
Yeah, I am.

80
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:46,433
Send me your location.

81
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:47,768
I need to talk to you in person.

82
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:49,478
I can reach that area in 30 minutes.

83
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:50,687
Okay, then.

84
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,689
- I'll send my location right now.
- Okay.

85
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,765
It's you, Judge Lee Han-young.

86
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,851
Who the hell are you?

87
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:38,735
This is where it ends.

88
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,283
It's you.

89
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:50,706
You know where you meet
your past life's enemy?

90
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,208
No, you wouldn't know.

91
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,085
But I think I do.

92
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,924
- Catch me if you can!
- My turn!

93
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:51,558
Director Lee isn't looking for the book.

94
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:53,435
It's Sin-jin.

95
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:57,147
CIVIL SERVICE OFFICE

96
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,903
You don't look tidy enough for the police.

97
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,322
There we go.

98
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,076
- Sorry!
- Sorry.

99
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:12,162
We're here to turn ourselves in.

100
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:15,540
Turn yourselves in?

101
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:23,632
He must know about the book
if he fought that hard for it.

102
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,302
You think you can get it back?

103
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,096
I'm by the junkyard

104
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:30,722
where he picked up the book.

105
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,851
It seems to be run by his family.

106
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,729
Send me the address and be on standby.

107
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,272
Yes, sir.

108
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:43,026
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

109
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,111
Okay.

110
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:47,447
Handeul Junkyard...

111
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,867
Hello? Hey, Chief Ban.

112
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,626
Sorry.

113
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,169
Oh, my!

114
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,171
Did you get hurt?

115
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,881
Is this why you were late?

116
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:06,007
It's nothing.

117
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,802
It looks pretty serious.

118
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:09,886
Are you sure?

119
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,431
It's just a little scratch.

120
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,809
=I'm glad you're fine, then.

121
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:19,187
Oh, you said you had something to tell me.

122
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:23,692
Is this for me?

123
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:24,943
Yes, you can drink it.

124
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,736
All the ice is melted.

125
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:37,581
Don't tell me...

126
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:41,877
The list of men exempted from the military
using Director Lee's false diagnoses.

127
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:44,129
Was I too loud?

128
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,840
No way.

129
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,343
KIM JUN-MAN
LEE YEONG-HYEON

130
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:51,636
Hey.

131
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,182
What? Who?

132
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,935
Okay, I'll call you later.

133
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:03,607
The junkyard is owned

134
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,443
by the mother of Judge Lee
at the Chungnam District Court.

135
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:07,736
What?

136
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:12,532
Right.

137
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:16,870
You said his family ran a junkyard.

138
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,791
This is too wicked to be fate.

139
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,002
Judge Lee, of all people.

140
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,644
Call it a day for now.

141
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:45,941
What is Han-young going to do
with the book?

142
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,401
If he recognizes the names on the list

143
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:50,820
there's no way he'll do something rashly.

144
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,906
Maybe.

145
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:56,201
Or he might have another plan.

146
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:59,496
But how would he react
if he were to realize

147
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,164
that we've been looking for the book?

148
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,337
No idea.

149
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,216
Since it's come to this

150
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:14,636
let's check what type Lee Han-young is.

151
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:19,307
So

152
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,227
this is insurance, in a way.

153
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,106
If I end up
not naming everyone on the list

154
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,607
release all the photos

155
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,067
you've just taken.

156
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,193
I got you.

157
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:31,611
In fact

158
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,197
I'd love to release them right now.

159
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:36,533
How about this, then?

160
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:40,036
The Gangcheon Palace thieves
just turned themselves in.

161
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:44,958
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

162
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:50,463
- Yes.
- Judge Lee?

163
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,173
I'm Presiding Judge Kim Jin-han

164
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,967
at the Seoul Central District Court.

165
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,930
MANWOL

166
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:11,067
I have no connection with Jin-han yet.

167
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:15,488
This means there's only one reason
he reached out to me.

168
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,201
The book of the draft dodgers.

169

Please rise for the VIP.

184
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,479
PARK GWANG-TO, FORMER PRESIDENT OF KOREA

185
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:30,689
Have a seat.

186
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:44,703
We will now commence

187
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:48,248
the third national cabinet reorganization.

188
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,083
I hereby table

189
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:54,045
the nomination of Chairman Woo Gyo-hun

190
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,755
for the Minister of Justice.

191
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,063
I'm surprised you were in Seoul.

192
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:15,859
I watched your serial killer trial
when I visited the Chungnam Court

193
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:17,694
and it left quite an impression on me.

194
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:20,280
I also read
about the insurance fraud trial.

195
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:22,907
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

196
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:27,370
Have some.

197
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:28,913
I just did what I had to do.

198
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,333
It's rare to see people doing their jobs
these days.

199
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,253
That was why you stood out to me.

200
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:38,798
How's this place?

201
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:43,762
You'll come here pretty often

202
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:45,555
once you start working at the Seoul Court.

203
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:47,766
Oh, and I'll take that

204
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,185
as your ticket to Seoul.

205
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:57,525
I guess you know what's in my briefcase.

206
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:04,324
It's nothing you need.

207
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:06,951
I hereby name Assemblyman Woo Gyo-hun

208
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:10,497
as the Minister of Justice
in the third cabinet.

209
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,754
We'll proceed with this
as a party priority.

210
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,550
Thank you, Your Excellency.

211
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,387
Prepare for the confirmation hearing

212
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:28,181
and serve our country well.

213
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,891
I will spare no effort

214
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:32,977
to serve the nation
as Korea's next Minister of Justice.

215
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:47,116
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

216
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,714
The people on the draft-dodger list

217
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:05,093
will fuel Sin-jin with wealth and power
until he becomes the biggest devil.

218
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:08,388
There's no way
I'm handing the book to Sin-jin.

219
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:12,225
From Justice Kim Jun-man
to the majority party leader

220
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:13,935
and the senior presidential secretary

221
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:16,729
you could form a whole cabinet
with just the people on the list.

222
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:18,398
I could ask any of them

223
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,567
for a ticket to Seoul.

224
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,485
Oops, it's rush hour soon.

225
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,866
Are you sure you won't regret this?

226
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:34,873
Mr. Kim

227
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,544
you've never truly regretted anything,
have you?

228
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:43,840
Because people finally feel regret
when death is at their doorstep.

229
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,885
At a point of no return.

230
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:53,391
It's like you've experienced death.

231
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:56,394
Of course not.

232
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,614
You know what hasn't changed

233
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,157
since my days at the Blue House

234
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,576
until here, at Suojae?

235
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:16,080
That the power of Korea still lies
in Your Excellency's hands.

236
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:17,415
Exactly.

237
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:20,084
But there's one more.

238
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:22,170
The guys at the meeting earlier.

239
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:24,589
They always talk about being patriots

240
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:26,549
but inside,
they only care about themselves.

241
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,343
They're all the same.

242
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:40,897
From helping their kids cheat in life
to bribery

243
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:43,775
and affairs.

244
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:47,320
This is a document on everyone
who frequents Suojae.

245
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,573
You take care of it.

246
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:52,784
Guard them as needed when they have issues

247
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:55,161
but if their issues seem too big,
cut them off.

248
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,247
Yes, Your Excellency.

249
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:05,296
You know why I'm trusting you with this?

250
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:07,840
You must have

251
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:10,426
some files on me, too, isn't that right?

252
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,221
Yes

253
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,890
you seem to use money as a tool.

254
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:18,059
So, instead of money

255
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,812
I've decided to let you bask in power.

256
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:22,897
Not bad, huh?

257
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:25,692
I promise my loyalty

258
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:27,944
to you and the nation under that power.

259
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:34,242
Right on.

260
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,703
He rejected my offer to move to Seoul.

261
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,205
He seemed adamant about keeping that book.

262
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:43,418
He's complicating everything.

263
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:45,712
I'll get in touch with him again soon.

264
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:49,716
As you should.

265
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:54,095
I look forward to working with you both.

266
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:55,763
Yeah, I got you.

267
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:00,601
Mr. Kang.

268
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:01,978
Okay.

269
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:07,400
Good work today.

270
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:12,196
By the way...

271
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,782
Gyo-hun! Come here already.

272
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:17,994
Hey, call me Minister Woo!

273
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:19,120
Come on.

274
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:29,130
CHIEF PROSECUTOR MA GANG-GIL

275
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:31,883
Yes?

276
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,969
Good work.

277
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,513
Let's have dinner together sometime.

278
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:48,191
Mr. Jang will be cleared of all charges.

279
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:51,778
I knew you could do it.

280
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:22,892
Hello, sir.

281
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:24,268
Please have a look at this.

282
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:28,940
What's this?

283
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,400
My mom runs a junkyard in Seoul

284
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:32,693
and gets all sorts of things.

285
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:34,654
May I turn on the TV?

286
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:36,197
Go ahead.

287
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,078
A group of three thieves

288
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,372
who stole
two billion won's worth of valuables

289
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,916
in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul,
turned themselves in.

290
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:50,336
They robbed the house
of the director of a famous hospital.

291
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:51,963
The group included

292
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:54,173
two deliverymen who frequented his house

293
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:55,466
and "Open Sesame"

294
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:59,387
who'd been charged
with safecracking three times.

295
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,638
Without the victim's report

296
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:02,974
the police didn't even know
about the robbery

297
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:04,767
until the three turned themselves in.

298
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,477
The police then rushed

299
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,437
to contact the victim
to confirm the theft.

300
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:09,939
Some are speculating

301
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:12,316
that the owner possibly didn't report
the missing items

302
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,235
because he needed to hide them.

303
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,197
I'll head to Chungcheongnam-do tomorrow.

304
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:21,075
Bring it back, no matter what.

305
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,620
The list even includes

306
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:28,291
the sons of Justice Kim Jun-man
and the senior presidential secretary.

307
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,210
If the world hears about this

308
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:35,548
it'll add immense stress on the President,
who only has a year left in his term.

309
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:37,884
But

310
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:42,513
why did you bring this to me?

311
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:46,184
This is beyond my power.

312
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,440
I thought I could count on you
to guard it better.

313
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:02,742
A poisoned chalice, you say...

314
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,288
I thought you were just a cub

315
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:09,498
but are you coming for my throat now?

316
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:23,971
Serving in the military is

317
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,059
an honorable responsibility
for all Korean men.

318
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:31,103
We must not allow those
with high social status

319
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,940
to meddle with this responsibility.

320
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:36,442
The courts of Korea will put

321
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:38,736
all of those involved
in conscription evasion

322
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,655
to strict trial under the law

323
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,991
regardless of their social statuses.

324
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:46,661
The court will condemn

325
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:49,330
not only those who evaded conscription

326
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:51,874
but also those who colluded in

327
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,585
or supported the evasion
without exception.

328
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:56,212
No preferential treatment

329
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:59,257
or tolerance will be allowed.

330
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:00,925
I will now read the names.

331
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:04,470
Party Leader Cho Hu-heon
of the Daehan Central Party

332
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,598
Justice Kim Jun-man

333
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:12,561
and Member Lee Yeong-hyeon
of the New People's Future Party.

334
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:15,481
Shin Tae-hyeon,
the CEO of Yeongryun Holdings

335
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,277
- Judge Yeon Eun-woo at the Seoul Court
- This bastard!

336
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,280
Kim Go-geum, the CEO of Pyeongguk Steel...

337
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:24,073
Is he out of his mind?

338
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:29,287
Mr. Lee.

339
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,040
If you were going to make
a big announcement

340
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:34,625
why did you even ask me
to take the photos?

341
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:35,710
I know.

342
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:38,838
I didn't expect Mr. Baek
to tell me to read the list myself.

343
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:41,424
You were awesome.

344
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:51,517
I read the list to see

345
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,060
who would get me a ticket to Seoul

346
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:58,691
and thought of my kindest buddy
from law school.

347
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:01,402
He somehow found out
my family ran a junkyard

348
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:04,697
and shows his concern for the junk prices
every time we hang out.

349
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:08,659
He also feels so bad about my being stuck

350
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:11,120
in regional courts my entire career

351
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:12,913
without any strings to pull.

352
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:16,125
I was hoping

353
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,711
I'd get the chance to console him,
and this was perfect.

354
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:23,007
But I couldn't just expose him
and not the others.

355
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:25,676
So, I just thought, "So be it."

356
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,219
And here we are.

357
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:28,304
You expect me

358
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:38,397
to believe that?

359
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:41,108
I'm serious.

360
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:49,367
That's too bad.

361
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,036
I prepared another gift
with your ticket to Seoul.

362
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:54,497
Should've come a bit earlier.

363
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:56,457
I have no regrets, though.

364
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:00,086
Getting your revenge is
better than anything

365
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:02,838
in movies and in reality, after all.

366
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:08,552
It must've been so thrilling

367
00:23:08,636 --> 00:23:10,221
to read the names of your colleagues.

368
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:13,766
But

369
00:23:15,684 --> 00:23:19,063
you've bothered quite a few
of the higher-ups with this.

370
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:21,982
You fine with that?

371
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:25,861
No, I can't bother them.

372
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:28,864
That's why

373
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:30,908
I've decided to say

374
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:33,577
Mr. Baek made me read the list in public.

375
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,454
Think about it.

376
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:37,123
Mr. Baek's career ends here, anyway.

377
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:39,291
But I'm only starting out.

378
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,430
Sorry.

379
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:56,809
For having the list exposed to the public?

380
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:02,398
Or for giving me only half of the list?

381
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:05,943
What are you more sorry for?

382
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:10,197
I missed a few updates and slipped.

383
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:11,657
Sorry.

384
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,035
You think I don't know you?

385
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,913
You never make mistakes.

386
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:25,880
Tell me.

387
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:29,008
What else do you have hiding in here?

388
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:33,846
Did I choose the wrong person?

389
00:24:35,222 --> 00:24:36,307
Sorry.

390
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:40,978
I won't mess up again.

391
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:54,033
Director Lee at Hanguk Hospital
had better be good at keeping secrets.

392
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:55,409
How much do you trust him?

393
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,204
I'll take care of it for good.

394
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,510
Your Excellency.

395
00:25:13,844 --> 00:25:14,887
Have a seat.

396
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:17,932
You too, Mr. Kang.

397
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:21,602
When's the confirmation hearing?

398
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:23,938
In about two weeks, Your Excellency.

399
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:25,981
It'll be war until then.

400
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:30,945
The press will look into everything,
even down to your socks.

401
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:33,906
They can hang me upside-down,
but time will still pass.

402
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,575
Whatever they ask me

403
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,453
I'll just say I'll answer them
at the confirmation hearing.

404
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:42,039
You still need to be well-prepared
for the hearing.

405
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:44,250
Mr. Kang, be his support.

406
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,751
Yes, Your Excellency.

407
00:25:46,252 --> 00:25:47,294
Your Excellency

408
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:50,422
those at the Ministry of Justice can help.

409
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:54,093
All these strangers will come at you
for every little thing.

410
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:56,512
Are you sure you can handle it?

411
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:02,351
Get rid of what you must

412
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,395
and hide what you must.

413
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:05,980
Yes, Your Excellency.

414
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:24,081
The office for the hearing preparation is
at the Yeonheung Building in Jongno.

415
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:25,624
Drop by when you have time.

416
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,253
At least pretend to help me.
It's His Excellency's order.

417
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:36,051
I didn't know people still used these.

418
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:40,222
My, my, Mr. Kang.

419
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:43,851
Seems like you were raised
to be very thrifty.

420
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:45,728
I guess so.

421
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:48,397
People sure don't change easily.

422
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:53,235
By the way

423
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:57,364
were you born to read the room
and adapt so well, too?

424
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,159
You only joined Suojae recently

425
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:03,037
yet you're His Excellency's right hand.

426
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:09,543
I don't mean it in a bad way.

427
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:12,087
As you know, people talk

428
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:15,215
when someone rises too quickly.

429
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:19,345
So

430
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:24,308
I hear you grew up
in a brothel in Cheongnyangni?

431
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:26,727
I'll be in touch with you soon.

432
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:29,855
Sure.

433
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:35,903
A kid from a brothel in Cheongnyangni...

434
00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:38,739
Wonder if he even knows his daddy.

435
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,584
What else do you have hiding in here?

436
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:55,923
Did I choose the wrong person?

437
00:27:57,716 --> 00:28:00,803
I hear you grew up
in a brothel in Cheongnyangni?

438
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:12,189
What?

439
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,858
Oh, yes.

440
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:17,903
Judge Lee seems to have exposed the list

441
00:28:17,986 --> 00:28:19,697
out of impulse.

442
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,032
The list includes
an old classmate from law school

443
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:24,993
with whom he didn't get along.

444
00:28:25,244 --> 00:28:26,412
You believe that?

445
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:29,039
He acted like he wanted the book

446
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:31,542
just to pass it onto Yi-seok.

447
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:34,837
He wanted something from Yi-seok.

448
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,963
He didn't do it

449
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:39,258
to get something

450
00:28:39,883 --> 00:28:42,052
but to protect his future.

451
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:44,304
He knows Yi-seok is stuck

452
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,640
at the Chungnam Court until the end

453
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,308
but he's only starting out.

454
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:50,018
He's not loyal.

455
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,354
He's just greedy for success.

456
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:55,274
So, he got his revenge by using Yi-seok?

457
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:58,610
As you know,
Judge Lee's parents run a junkyard.

458
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:00,195
A classmate bullied him

459
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,614
and made snarky comments about that

460
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:05,909
saying scrap papers and metal
didn't cost much.

461
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:08,912
And he mocked him
for attending an unimpressive school.

462
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:11,081
So, he dropped a bomb to kill a fly?

463
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:18,881
If he used Yi-seok to expose the list

464
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:22,134
he's definitely not on Yi-seok's side.

465
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:25,846
But

466
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,682
we'd better warn him, still.

467
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,769
Leave Han-young to me

468
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:36,148
and meet Director Lee of Hanguk Hospital.

469
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:38,609
I'm sure he's plenty worried.

470
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:41,320
Yes, sir.

471
00:29:57,753 --> 00:29:59,463
About the guy who took the bag.

472
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:01,465
What's going on?

473
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:06,011
They used fake diagnoses
to avoid enlistment.

474
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:07,095
They deserve to be punished.

475
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:08,680
What other reason do I need?

476
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:11,141
Do you know what Mr. Baek just did?

477
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:12,559
The moment he exposed

478
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:14,269
every powerful person and their kids

479
00:30:14,353 --> 00:30:17,022
he said goodbye
to becoming a Justice for good.

480
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:20,734
I told my wife to sell our house
because we were moving to Seoul.

481
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:23,737
Are you mad at me
because you can't go to Seoul?

482
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:24,905
Damn right!

483
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:27,991
Had Mr. Baek been appointed,
I could've joined him.

484
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:29,618
What do I tell my wife now?

485
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:31,245
Call your wife right now!

486
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:32,704
What if she sells your house?

487
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:35,999
Oh, right.

488
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,668
She can't sell our house.

489
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:39,044
Thanks.

490
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:42,214
Actually, can you talk to her for me?

491
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:43,674
I'm too scared to tell her.

492
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:45,425
- Tell who?
- My wife.

493
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:49,096
Good luck.

494
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:53,600
You're as loyal as a speck of dust.

495
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:55,060
Pay for this, then.

496
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:00,148
Can't I just text her?

497
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,359
She'll get madder
at how unserious you are.

498
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:03,944
Right.

499
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,826
Yi-seok lost his chance
of becoming a Justice

500
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:12,286
when he dropped the draft-dodger bomb.

501
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,913
But the aftermath
of the draft-dodger scandal

502
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:17,249
will bring Yi-seok to Seoul.

503
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:25,507
Are you okay?

504
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:27,134
I'm fine.

505
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:29,928
That guy!

506
00:31:30,012 --> 00:31:31,013
Over there.

507
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:38,854
We have to get out!

508
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:41,273
Let's go!

509
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,282
That bastard!

510
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:52,075
He definitely lost in court.

511
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:02,961
Honey!

512
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:19,478
This is

513
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:22,940
definitely a warning
for exposing the draft-dodger list.

514
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,502
I warned him. He'll get the message.

515
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,003
Yeah, good work.

516
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:48,340
I'll give you a new task soon.

517
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:50,592
Wait until I call you.

518
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:00,686
Yi-seok risked his future as a Justice

519
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:02,145
to expose this list.

520
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:05,691
Is this about Yi-seok's principle

521
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,194
or Han-young's wit?

522
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:22,290
Hey

523
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:25,293
I guess there's a silver lining
in everything.

524
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:27,254
These few stitches were enough

525
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:28,922
to keep my wife from getting mad

526
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:31,008
about not going to Seoul.

527
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,179
My wife took
the house listing down herself, too.

528
00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:37,431
That's great.

529
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:38,515
It sure is.

530
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:46,023
By the way, that motorcycle.

531
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,941
It looks familiar.

532
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:49,568
Really?

533
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:51,528
Yeah, I have a feeling

534
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:55,032
it's one of the defendants
from my past trials.

535
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,784
Man...

536
00:33:58,994 --> 00:34:01,872
He definitely has an issue
with my verdict.

537
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:02,956
Hey, that hurts.

538
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:06,418
That's the thing about being a judge.

539
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:09,963
You have to be ready to die for justice
if it comes down to it.

540
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,257
You were, yesterday.

541
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,925
You almost died.

542
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:16,428
This is Presiding Judge Kang
from the Seoul Central Court.

543
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:35,822
Sin-jin directly reached out to me.

544
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:38,033
He wants to check me out.

545
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:44,915
Sometimes, we see a person

546
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:48,335
and say, "They could live without the law
and still be good."

547
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,545
But today's guest is

548
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,508
someone who absolutely cannot live
without the law.

549
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:57,636
Please welcome Chief Justice Kang Sin-jin!

550
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:04,726
Nice to meet you, sir.

551
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:06,895
Please have a seat.

552
00:35:14,152 --> 00:35:17,072
In our previous lives, he killed me
without having spoken a word with me

553
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:20,659
but he wants to team up with me
as soon as we meet this time?

554
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,371
Sure.

555
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:28,625
If that's what it takes to get you.

556
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:40,053
You had a rough night last night,
didn't you?

557
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:42,222
Are you alright?

558
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:46,476
The arrogance to point out
that he was the one who attacked me.

559
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:49,187
Sin-jin

560
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,817
one day,
that arrogance will eat you up alive.

561
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:58,905
If this is about the list, I'm sorry.

562
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:02,784
You needed it for the greater good

563
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:04,661
but my temper got the best of me.

564
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:08,039
I was going to do it
when the time was right.

565
00:36:09,624 --> 00:36:12,169
From Justice Kim Jun-man

566
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:15,505
to all those
acting like they're better than everyone.

567
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:17,799
Can't believe what they were doing
behind our backs.

568
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:20,260
Good job.

569
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:22,637
But

570
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:27,642
I hope this was a good lesson for you.

571
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:33,148
I definitely felt it, physically.
I'll remember my lesson.

572
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:35,692
And please,
no need to speak to me so formally.

573
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:37,652
Alright, then.

574
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:03,637
I get happy
when I see food piled up like that.

575
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,766
As a kid, I wanted nothing
but to have a big meal.

576
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:11,645
Let's eat.

577
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:19,194
When I look at you

578
00:37:19,277 --> 00:37:21,071
I can almost physically see your elegance.

579
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:23,865
You look like you must've been raised

580
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:26,534
very properly in a rich family.

581
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:28,995
- Me?
- Yes.

582
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:31,706
Your laugh tells me otherwise, though.

583
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:35,710
CHIEF JUSTICE KANG SIN-JIN
AT THE HEART OF THE JUDICIARY

584
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:37,128
You know that song?

585
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,590
"My family was poor"

586
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:41,675
GENTLY RECITING THE LYRICS

587
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,218
"for as long as I could remember."

588
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:47,389
"We never even ate out
like other families."

589
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:52,060
"Then, one day, Mother..."

590
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:55,730
"Jjajang."

591
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:59,025
Yes, it goes, "Mother said
she didn't like jjajangmyeon."

592
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:01,861
Are you sharing

593
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:06,199
a sad story about your mother?

594
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:08,868
No.

595
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,747
Whenever I listened to that song

596
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,586
I wished I had a mother like that.

597
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,921
Sorry?

598
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:22,090
You mean...

599
00:38:24,926 --> 00:38:26,720
Yes, I was an orphan.

600
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:32,017
I've never seen my parents

601
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:35,645
since childhood until now.

602
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,818
Didn't I do pretty well

603
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:45,947
to have become who I am, despite that?

604
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:50,076
You didn't just do pretty well.

605
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,913
Everyone, let's give him
a round of applause.

606
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,919
Yes, that's it.

607
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,467
My parents were evicted.

608
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:09,637
Jjajangmyeon was reserved
for special days.

609
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:12,474
When my friends and I passed
the stationery shop

610
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:16,061
they would look at the 500-won toys

611
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:19,105
and bluff about buying them.

612
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:21,232
Whenever that happened

613
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:23,568
I couldn't say anything.

614
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:25,820
Why?

615
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:28,114
It was bluffing, anyway.

616
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:31,868
Those friends had

617
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:35,622
fathers

618
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:38,249
who had pay days.

619
00:39:43,254 --> 00:39:44,297
I see.

620
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:51,971
Did Yi-seok take the book without a word?

621
00:39:53,473 --> 00:39:56,309
His career is at a dead-end
at the Chungnam Court, anyway.

622
00:39:58,353 --> 00:40:00,814
But I heard he was a Justice candidate.

623
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:05,693
Mr. Baek values honor more than anything.

624
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:08,947
Refusing to take the book from me

625
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,783
would've felt like a dishonor.

626
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:15,328
What do you think I'm like?

627
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:19,374
You look like someone who can lead me.

628
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:22,752
How are you so sure of that?

629
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,631
We just met today.

630
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,261
I remember you visiting the court.

631
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:32,929
You noticed me?

632
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:34,722
I'll do everything it takes

633
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:37,767
to become someone you need.

634
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:51,990
The confirmation hearing

635
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:53,950
for Chairman Woo Gyo-hun is in two weeks.

636
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:56,202
Can you oust him before that?

637
00:41:05,378 --> 00:41:08,423
Gyo-hun becomes the Minister of Justice
until the end of this presidency

638
00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:11,217
and steps down with the President.

639
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:13,720
I can do that.

640
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:16,139
Don't you want to know what for?

641
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:17,932
Do I need to know what for?

642
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:21,186
You're funny.

643
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:27,650
CHAIRMAN JANG YONG-HYEON OF S GROUP

644
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:34,115
Yes?

645
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,117
An arrest warrant for CEO Jang Tae-sik?

646
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,702
I thought we were done with that!

647
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:39,454
There's the arrest warrant examination

648
00:41:39,537 --> 00:41:41,080
so he should be released after that.

649
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:43,249
The draft-dodger list is
the talk of the town!

650
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,126
What if he gets blamed for that, too?

651
00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:47,754
With everyone paying attention
to that one big issue

652
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:50,340
they'll talk less about this one.

653
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:52,383
A higher-up
or a conglomerate family member

654
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:54,594
under an arrest warrant examination?

655
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:58,348
Mr. Jang, you're under emergency arrest
on charges of offshore tax evasion.

656
00:41:58,765 --> 00:42:00,099
Jang Tae-sik.

657
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:02,560
That means Sin-jin is talking

658
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:04,938
to Chairman Jang Yong-hyeon of S Group.

659
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:08,483
Sin-jin had ties to Chairman Jang

660
00:42:08,566 --> 00:42:10,485
before his son, Tae-sik.

661
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:12,946
I'll believe you

662
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:15,573
for now

663
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:19,452
but I'll go to Suojae myself
if anything happens.

664
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:29,921
Some people like to ignore the fact
that we're all equal before the law.

665
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:32,632
But the time will come

666
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:35,718
and when it's time, I'll teach them

667
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:39,430
how obvious, yet terrifying that is.

668
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:43,643
That's

669
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:45,770
how the law is.

670
00:43:02,996 --> 00:43:06,207
HANGUK HOSPITAL

671
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:11,421
Director Lee

672
00:43:14,841 --> 00:43:16,718
the prosecutorial summons
is tomorrow, right?

673
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:18,720
Yes.

674
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,639
Just suffer for six months

675
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:24,559
and you'll at least get
your medical license back.

676
00:43:26,978 --> 00:43:28,021
What?

677
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:32,650
Thank you!

678
00:43:33,985 --> 00:43:35,528
- Thank you!
- Come on. Sit.

679
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:46,998
Defendant

680
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,667
you're under emergency arrest

681
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:51,377
on charges of offshore tax evasion.

682
00:43:55,757 --> 00:43:56,758
Defendant?

683
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:59,052
DEFENDANT

684
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:01,638
You have to answer this yourself, sir.

685
00:44:01,721 --> 00:44:03,389
That's a nuisance.

686
00:44:04,515 --> 00:44:05,516
Defendant

687
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:08,144
do you admit
to your charges of offshore tax evasion?

688
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:11,481
No.

689
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:13,232
Bullshit.

690
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:14,859
Excuse me?

691
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:16,694
Did she just swear at me?

692
00:44:16,778 --> 00:44:18,029
Yes, I definitely heard it.

693
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,031
Defendant

694
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:22,408
please calm down.

695
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:25,787
Are you currently the CEO of S Shopping?

696
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,623
Yes, I run 17 department stores

697
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:31,167
and 120 grocery stores... Wait, how many?

698
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,251
It's 127, sir.

699
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,753
Yeah, 127 stores.

700
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,839
Your Honor, you should visit
our department store.

701
00:44:36,923 --> 00:44:39,175
I'll give you VIP treatment.

702
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:49,769
Mr. Jang.

703
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:53,022
What now?

704
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:55,525
We're not done
with your offshore tax evasion case.

705
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:57,527
Don't go too far

706
00:44:57,944 --> 00:45:00,571
and come to the Prosecutors' Office
when summoned.

707
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,825
Didn't you hear me earlier?

708
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:07,954
I have 17 department stores
and 127 grocery stores.

709
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:11,541
Would you leave all that and go far away
if you were in my place?

710
00:45:14,252 --> 00:45:16,629
By the way, you cussed at me, didn't you?

711
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:18,172
Me?

712
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,842
- When?
- "When?"

713
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:22,468
You cussed at me earlier!

714
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:24,887
We should go. The reporters are coming.

715
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:26,264
Tell them to come!

716
00:45:26,347 --> 00:45:28,516
How dare a prosecutor cuss in court?

717
00:45:33,146 --> 00:45:34,772
Could you explain your charges?

718
00:45:34,856 --> 00:45:35,982
Sir!

719
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,401
- Mr. Jang!
- Wait!

720
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:40,027
Do you admit to your charges?

721
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:41,529
- Mr. Jang!
- Sir!

722
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:43,948
What a load of bullshit.

723
00:45:55,918 --> 00:45:59,338
Can't believe I'm eating this early
because of some prosecutor bitch.

724
00:45:59,422 --> 00:46:00,673
Damn it.

725
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:08,598
But wait. How much does it cost

726
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:11,893
to buy a prosecutor like that?

727
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:18,316
I'm hungry.

728
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:20,067
- I'll take the same.
- Yes, sir.

729
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:23,863
You can't even afford breakfast now?

730
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:28,034
Dad

731
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:31,662
what clarifying evidence
did you hand over to the prosecution?

732
00:46:31,746 --> 00:46:34,999
I told your employee to prepare it
because you're so bad at your job.

733
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:38,461
I took care of it once and for all

734
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:40,338
so you won't get arrested for it again.

735
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:41,881
Okay.

736
00:46:47,386 --> 00:46:50,014
I'm Kim Pyeong-guk of General Affairs.

737
00:46:51,682 --> 00:46:52,683
Is this the guy?

738
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:53,935
Yeah.

739
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:56,771
You're finished with that, yeah?

740
00:46:56,854 --> 00:46:57,855
Yeah.

741
00:47:09,283 --> 00:47:10,284
Hey!

742
00:47:10,368 --> 00:47:12,161
Hey, stand straight.

743
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:15,081
Who pays you your salary?

744
00:47:15,915 --> 00:47:17,917
Do you work for S Group?

745
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:20,753
Why are you taking orders
from someone else

746
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,588
when I'm the one paying you?

747
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:25,049
Mr. Jang.

748
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:26,175
I just...

749
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:28,469
- It was your father's order.
- Shut it.

750
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:32,181
Dad, you can take the guy.

751
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:34,100
If he's so damn good at his job!

752
00:47:34,934 --> 00:47:38,187
I don't want to pay a guy
who will work for another guy, either.

753
00:47:40,398 --> 00:47:41,399
Mr. Jang!

754
00:47:41,774 --> 00:47:44,360
I did it because I was told it'd help you!

755
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:46,654
I didn't have any other motives!

756
00:47:46,737 --> 00:47:48,531
Yeah, exactly.

757
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:52,076
If it's supposed to help me,
why am I the only one who doesn't know?

758
00:47:52,743 --> 00:47:53,744
Mr. Jang.

759
00:47:53,828 --> 00:47:54,871
- Hey, Byeon!
- Yes, sir.

760
00:47:54,954 --> 00:47:56,956
What are you doing?
Throw him out right now!

761
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:58,624
- Please get out.
- Mr. Jang!

762
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:18,895
Dad

763
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:20,730
just give me a little more time.

764
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:23,608
This is only the beginning.

765

Wait! Lee Chang-hyo...

774
00:51:29,543 --> 00:51:30,544
What?

775
00:51:54,568 --> 00:51:56,654
MY LAST LETTER

776
00:51:56,737 --> 00:51:58,364
I VIOLATED THE LAW AS A KOREAN CITIZEN
AND A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL

777
00:51:58,447 --> 00:52:00,491
ONCE AGAIN, I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
TO THE WHOLE NATION

778
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:08,040
SINCERELY, LEE CHANG-HYO

779
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:30,604
Hey, Han-young.

780
00:52:31,188 --> 00:52:32,523
Lee Chang-hyo's gone.

781
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,876
I was a bit too late.

782
00:53:01,302 --> 00:53:02,469
Director Lee Chang-hyo of Hanguk Hospital

783
00:53:02,553 --> 00:53:04,805
who was under the allegation
that he gave false diagnoses

784
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:06,891
to help men get an exemption
from conscription

785
00:53:06,974 --> 00:53:08,475
jumped off a building and died.

786
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:11,812
He is suspected to have taken his own life

787
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:14,523
under great pressure
before being summoned by the prosecution.

788
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,483
According to the prosecution

789
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:19,195
the confiscated flash drive had
the same list

790
00:53:19,278 --> 00:53:21,530
as the one in the book of draft dodgers.

791
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,908
Under the speculation

792
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:26,285
that there was someone
who acted as an informant

793
00:53:26,368 --> 00:53:28,495
the prosecution planned
to extend the investigation

794
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:30,164
but with Director Lee's death

795
00:53:30,247 --> 00:53:32,750
further investigation may not continue.

796
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:35,669
Sin-jin chopped his tail off.

797
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:38,297
Because Director Lee's words could tell

798
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,716
his biggest weaknesses.

799
00:53:50,142 --> 00:53:51,936
I can't ask a prosecutor to dig

800
00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:53,896
into a Ministry of Justice candidate.

801
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:10,746
Hey, kid!

802
00:54:11,705 --> 00:54:13,374
Where do you think you're going?

803
00:54:18,212 --> 00:54:20,297
You said you'd take all the food
past the best-before date.

804
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:21,799
I didn't mean

805
00:54:22,383 --> 00:54:23,467
every day.

806
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,011
Come every day.

807
00:54:30,724 --> 00:54:31,725
Huh?

808
00:54:33,435 --> 00:54:34,436
Never mind.

809
00:54:35,104 --> 00:54:36,105
Here.

810
00:54:41,026 --> 00:54:42,403
Hey, Han-young.

811
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,283
Yeah.

812
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,244
Can you dig into someone's background?

813
00:54:50,661 --> 00:54:51,704
Who is it?

814
00:54:52,371 --> 00:54:55,040
Woo Gyo-hun. He's an assemblyman.
Can you do it?

815
00:54:55,124 --> 00:54:56,709
What? Woo...

816
00:54:59,211 --> 00:55:01,797
WOO GYO-HUN, NOMINATED
AS THE NEXT MINISTER OF JUSTICE

817
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:06,260
Of course!

818
00:55:06,343 --> 00:55:08,887
You know me. I can do anything.

819
00:55:09,388 --> 00:55:11,140
I'll look into him and let you know.

820
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:21,525
My gosh, seriously.

821
00:55:21,608 --> 00:55:24,194
Babe, shouldn't you go to another country?

822
00:55:24,278 --> 00:55:25,904
Before they assign a travel ban?

823
00:55:25,988 --> 00:55:28,365
Come on, babe.

824
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:30,117
My father is a Justice.

825
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,953
We live in Korea.
They don't arrest everyone

826
00:55:33,037 --> 00:55:34,580
just because they're on the list.

827
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:36,540
That's true.

828
00:55:36,623 --> 00:55:39,293
Korea is heaven for the rich
with the right connections.

829
00:55:39,376 --> 00:55:41,337
That's why money and connections are

830
00:55:41,462 --> 00:55:44,131
basically God here.

831
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:51,555
Who the hell are you?

832
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:57,603
Park Cheol-woo, a prosecutor of Korea.

833
00:55:57,686 --> 00:55:58,687
Mr. Kim Jeong-gyun

834
00:55:58,771 --> 00:56:01,690
you're under emergency arrest
for violating the Military Service Act.

835
00:56:01,774 --> 00:56:04,651
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to remain silent.

836
00:56:04,735 --> 00:56:05,736
You heard me, right?

837
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:08,030
Honestly, you're embarrassing me!

838
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:11,825
You bastards, you know who my father is?

839
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:14,870
He's the freaking Justice!

840
00:56:14,953 --> 00:56:16,872
Where are you guys from?

841
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:20,584
Just wait and see.

842
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,462
Babe.

843
00:56:23,837 --> 00:56:24,963
What? Hold on.

844
00:56:26,006 --> 00:56:27,674
- Look over there.
- What?

845
00:56:27,758 --> 00:56:29,301
Just look at that!

846
00:56:34,723 --> 00:56:37,559
JUSTICE KIM JUN-MAN ARRESTED
FOR HIS SON'S ALLEGED DRAFT DODGING

847
00:56:40,312 --> 00:56:41,355
Father?

848
00:56:44,691 --> 00:56:46,402
You still want to know where I'm from?

849
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:51,365
My, my.

850
00:56:52,324 --> 00:56:55,077
It can't get more embarrassing than this.

851
00:56:55,744 --> 00:56:56,787
EOM JUN-HO
PROSECUTOR GENERAL

852
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,080
Yi-seok, that damn bastard.

853
00:56:58,163 --> 00:57:01,125
He should've just stayed quiet
at the Chungnam Court until the end

854
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:03,210
and enjoyed his authority there.

855
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:07,506
Can't believe he used some newbie
to get everyone like this.

856
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:09,258
Don't you agree?

857
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:11,552
Your son will be investigated separately.

858
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:16,473
You're

859
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:18,642
two classes after me, yeah?

860
00:57:20,102 --> 00:57:22,980
Everyone's a former official
once our badges come off.

861
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:26,775
You have to earn what you can
while you serve the nation

862
00:57:26,859 --> 00:57:28,193
and still have your position.

863
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,820
So

864
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:33,282
take good care of your colleagues,
old and young, while you have the power.

865
00:57:33,907 --> 00:57:35,617
If you mess with the Judiciary

866
00:57:35,826 --> 00:57:37,953
even your former title will mean nothing.

867
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:41,665
You understand

868
00:57:42,249 --> 00:57:43,417
what I mean?

869
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:49,631
The Senior Presidential Economic Advisor
will join us soon

870
00:57:50,132 --> 00:57:52,050
for draft dodging charges, too.

871
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:01,685
Have a good time, and get home safely.

872
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:03,687
Treat him well.

873
00:58:04,354 --> 00:58:05,689
Don't miss a single detail.

874
00:58:05,772 --> 00:58:06,857
Yes, sir.

875
00:58:09,526 --> 00:58:10,527
Mr. Kim

876
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:14,907
serving in the military is
an honorable responsibility

877
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,992
that comes before any duty
of any officials.

878
00:58:20,913 --> 00:58:22,164
Hey!

879
00:58:24,374 --> 00:58:27,377
PROSECUTOR GENERAL EOM JUN-HO

880
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,379
I didn't know

881
00:58:30,088 --> 00:58:31,798
we had another brat like Yi-seok here.

882
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:39,932
Damn it.

883
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:48,023
JUSTICE IS DEAD

884
00:58:48,607 --> 00:58:50,234
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

885
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:52,486
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON
OUR COUNTRY IS FALLING APART!

886
00:58:54,363 --> 00:58:57,157
The trial for the case of draft dodging
went at an unprecedented speed

887
00:58:57,324 --> 00:59:00,077
even for the Senior Economic Advisor,
who resisted until the end.

888
00:59:02,246 --> 00:59:03,914
The Chief Justice resigned

889
00:59:03,997 --> 00:59:05,457
and with the draft dodging scandal

890
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,377
thinking that it'd lost
the nation's trust and respect

891
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,004
the President's Office screwed
with the Judiciary big time.

892
00:59:12,673 --> 00:59:13,674
JUSTICE CANNOT BE RESTORED
WITHOUT FAIR CONSCRIPTION RULES!

893
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:15,509
Breaking news.

894
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:18,470
The Blue House nominated Jeon Heung-woo
of the Jeju District Court

895
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:21,431
as the next Chief Justice.

896
00:59:21,932 --> 00:59:23,850
- Mr. Jeon has been extraordinary...
- First

897
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:25,811
I will ensure

898
00:59:25,894 --> 00:59:27,688
that integrity and fairness are

899
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:29,189
the foundation of the Judiciary.

900
00:59:29,648 --> 00:59:31,441
Trust in the Judiciary begins

901
00:59:31,525 --> 00:59:34,278
with the integrity of every judge.

902
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:37,531
I will ensure every case is judged
and every word is written fairly

903
00:59:37,614 --> 00:59:41,535
and without being in anyone's favor.

904
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:42,911
Secondly

905
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:44,746
I will establish...

906
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:47,708
Jeon, who graduated from a local college
with an underwhelming career

907
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:50,544
mercilessly purged people
under the name of reform

908
00:59:50,627 --> 00:59:53,213
as soon as he became the Chief Justice.

909
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:55,340
And

910
00:59:57,342 --> 00:59:58,468
as I'd expected

911
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:01,471
Heung-woo took an interest in Yi-seok.

912
01:00:02,848 --> 01:00:06,184
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

913
01:00:06,518 --> 01:00:07,936
How are you feeling?

914
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,187
All better now?

915
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,189
Yes, I'm all good.

916
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,983
I'm glad.

917
01:00:15,777 --> 01:00:19,323
Chief Justice Jeon called me himself.

918
01:00:19,865 --> 01:00:21,658
He invited me to work at the Seoul Court.

919
01:00:24,661 --> 01:00:25,787
Congratulations.

920
01:00:26,872 --> 01:00:28,248
But I turned him down.

921
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:35,964
What? Why?

922
01:00:36,256 --> 01:00:37,257
But

923
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:42,179
he offered two more tickets to Seoul.

924
01:00:44,264 --> 01:00:45,265
So?

925
01:00:47,225 --> 01:00:48,685
Senior Presiding Judge Lim

926
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:51,188
and Judge Lee

927
01:00:52,397 --> 01:00:54,316
you're coming to Seoul with me.

928
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:11,375
Oh, gosh! What a relief.

929
01:01:17,297 --> 01:01:18,298
Mr. Kang.

930
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:19,591
Yes.

931
01:01:21,301 --> 01:01:22,636
Yi-seok is coming to Seoul.

932
01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:27,265
I'm guessing
he'll bring Jeong-sik with him.

933
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:29,142
And Han-young.

934
01:01:30,268 --> 01:01:31,269
Is that so?

935
01:01:32,896 --> 01:01:36,358
Looks like Han-young
used that damn book to 200%.

936
01:01:37,609 --> 01:01:39,528
Based on how Yi-seok is bringing Han-young

937
01:01:39,611 --> 01:01:42,864
it looks like the draft-dodging scandal
made him trust Han-young more.

938
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:44,783
Guess so.

939
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:47,244
How was

940
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:49,287
Judge Lee?

941
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:51,123
What do you think I'm like?

942
01:01:52,749 --> 01:01:55,335
You look like someone who can lead me.

943
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,421
He's interesting.

944
01:01:57,879 --> 01:02:00,048
He's as clever as he's ambitious.

945
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,802
It doesn't matter
what Yi-seok thinks of Han-young.

946
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:05,470
He won't join Yi-seok's side.

947
01:02:07,305 --> 01:02:08,807
Presumptuous of me to say

948
01:02:09,474 --> 01:02:10,892
but isn't it too early to think so?

949
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:13,937
Yeah, that's presumptuous of you.

950
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:16,565
I'll keep an eye on him.

951
01:02:16,648 --> 01:02:17,649
Don't worry.

952
01:02:19,443 --> 01:02:21,278
But I wonder

953
01:02:22,612 --> 01:02:24,322
if he'll still do my homework

954
01:02:24,406 --> 01:02:26,616
now that he doesn't need my reward.

955
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:28,535
Or if he'll just give up.

956
01:02:28,869 --> 01:02:30,454
What do you mean by "homework"?

957
01:02:30,662 --> 01:02:32,164
I told him to get rid of Gyo-hun.

958
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:35,625
I feel like he'll stab me in the back
if I just let him be.

959
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,503
It's too early to trust Han-young.

960
01:02:38,587 --> 01:02:40,630
Maybe I'll take care of Gyo-hun's case...

961
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:43,175
Again, presumptuous.

962
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,469
I told you I'd keep an eye on him.

963
01:02:46,887 --> 01:02:49,181
Look more into Han-young instead.

964
01:02:49,264 --> 01:02:51,349
Look into his upbringing

965
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:53,477
whether he's ever been evicted, and so on.

966
01:02:54,394 --> 01:02:55,687
And

967
01:02:56,146 --> 01:02:58,565
move your guy
from the Chungnam Court to Seoul.

968
01:02:59,357 --> 01:03:01,526
Make him keep watching Yi-seok

969
01:03:01,985 --> 01:03:03,528
and Han-young, too.

970
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:08,116
Yes, sir.

971
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:30,597
After the government changed,
and Prosecutor General Eom resigned

972
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,724
his son, who was studying abroad,
visited Korea

973
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:34,559
and got arrested for drug charges.

974
01:03:35,602 --> 01:03:38,605
And one of the people arrested with him
was Gyo-hun's daughter

975
01:03:38,688 --> 01:03:41,316
- Woo Hui-yeong.
- Ms. Woo, do you admit to your charges?

976
01:03:55,872 --> 01:03:58,375
Why does Sin-jin want to crack down
on Gyo-hun?

977
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:02,170
Does he know Sin-jin's weak spot?

978
01:04:27,571 --> 01:04:29,573
The real deal begins now.

979
01:04:31,575 --> 01:04:33,243
Let's head to Haenal Law Firm first.

980
01:04:35,328 --> 01:04:38,665
HAENAL LAW FIRM

981
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:47,215
In my previous life,
I was a slave to Haenal Law Firm.

982
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:49,676
That, too, was my choice

983
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:51,469
that only ended in my unjustified death.

984
01:04:54,556 --> 01:04:55,849
Yu Seon-cheol, the Partner at Haenal.

985
01:04:56,683 --> 01:04:58,226
You chose me again

986
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,519
in this life.

987
01:05:00,979 --> 01:05:03,565
But in this life

988
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:04,649
I decide

989
01:05:05,108 --> 01:05:06,902
your fate.

990
01:05:07,402 --> 01:05:10,947
THE JUDGE RETURNS

991
01:05:35,055 --> 01:05:37,641
The son of the Prosecutor General
is doing drugs in the States.

992
01:05:37,724 --> 01:05:39,643
- So?
- And so is Woo Gyo-hun's daughter.

993
01:05:39,726 --> 01:05:42,145
I think Woo Gyo-hun is mixed up
with the Nammyeon District Mayor.

994
01:05:42,228 --> 01:05:43,396
Looks like he was paid off pretty well.

995
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,190
He was part of the Obok gang.

996
01:05:45,273 --> 01:05:47,359
You can take
the Nammyeon District sinkhole case.

997
01:05:47,442 --> 01:05:50,278
The sinkhole was caused by
faulty water and sewer construction.

998
01:05:50,362 --> 01:05:52,781
Hurry and deal with the guy
who died in the sinkhole first.

999
01:05:53,031 --> 01:05:54,032
He deserved it.

1000
01:05:54,115 --> 01:05:55,700
With the investigation going nowhere

1001
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:58,161
the victims blamed
the Nammyeon District Office.

1002
01:05:58,244 --> 01:06:01,331
He knows exactly how to use me
to his advantage.

1003
01:06:01,414 --> 01:06:02,540
You need to take action.

1004
01:06:02,624 --> 01:06:05,877
Kang Sin-jin,
you're going to end up in court.

1005
01:06:08,922 --> 01:06:10,924
