marriage efficiency or something?

08:49.133 --> 08:50.400
Why wouldn't I?

08:50.400 --> 08:52.733
Think of the time and cost spent dating,
dining, and having coffee.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.200

When I came back with tissues
and dry-cleaning money, he was already gone.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.300

them at work... ugh!

09:38.600 --> 09:40.933
I didn't want Team Leader Bang to see me,

09:45.067 --> 09:48.233

09:48.233 --> 09:51.333

couldn't really see.

10:39.433 --> 10:43.867
Every guy who tried flirting
with you eventually gave up.

10:43.867 --> 10:47.267
That's because they tried
to rush things way too fast.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.657
Hui Won, you need to
drop that old-fashioned idea

10:49.657 --> 10:51.000

10:51.000 --> 10:52.800

- It's not that, seriously.

11:59.067 --> 12:01.233
- Three, six, nine. Three, six, nine!
- Bang!

I told you I should go keep an eye on him.

12:32.767 --> 12:34.767
You know that blind date the other day?

12:34.767 --> 12:38.500
He set Chae Yeon's childhood pictures
as his phone wallpaper

and even pretended to be her father.

12:42.133 --> 12:43.300
Oh, my head...

12:43.300 --> 12:45.433
I had to explain that mess...

12:45.433 --> 12:49.367
He's that desperate not to get married,
so let's give him some time.

12:49.367 --> 12:52.033
You calm down too.

12:52.033 --> 12:53.900

13:03.033 --> 13:04.767
How exactly?

13:04.767 --> 13:08.700
Like last time, when everything blew up,
and you only showed up to clean the mess?

13:08.700 --> 13:11.933
He's not acting this way for no reason.

13:11.933 --> 13:15.233
It's that pointless
sense of responsibility of his.

13:15.233 --> 13:17.833
From what I see, Jeong Eum must be

13:17.833 --> 13:19.567
pressuring Du Jun somehow...

I love talking about myself.

13:36.028 --> 13:37.871
Oh.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.400
Well, since Du Jun

13:40.400 --> 13:44.900
keeps avoiding blind dates
and refuses to get married...

13:44.900 --> 13:47.733
Is marriage really necessary?

13:47.733 --> 13:50.767
It's not like marriage guarantees
you won't end up alone.

13:50.767 --> 13:52.500
Just like me.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.033
Excuse me for a moment.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.367

when he stabs me in the back.

14:24.567 --> 14:25.800
Sorry, it's work-related.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.733
Oh, yes.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.067
It's okay.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.633
But seriously, why don't you
want to get married?

15:04.633 --> 15:05.967
I can't.

15:05.967 --> 15:08.267
I said I can't do it.

15:09.679 --> 15:13.231
No! No!

15:14.033 --> 15:17.833

after destroying a family with my own hands?

15:59.133 --> 16:02.900

the youngest manager for nothing.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.867
What, did she even brag about proving it?

16:04.867 --> 16:06.767
Even without that, the Germany slot
is obviously Manager Jang's.

16:06.767 --> 16:07.800
Germany?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.167
Guess you haven't heard, Se Hyeon.

16:09.167 --> 16:12.467
Every three years, the company
picks top-performing employees

16:12.467 --> 16:13.900
for a study program in Germany.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.567
But competition's insane these days,

16:16.567 --> 16:18.333
so rumor is they're even
scoring creativity now.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.667
Still, who could possibly beat Manager Jang?

16:20.667 --> 16:25.300
I've never seen anyone so relentless
in new product development.

16:25.300 --> 16:28.533
She heard minerals were
used in medicine and cosmetics

16:28.533 --> 16:31.500
and went mining for ones
that could work in beer.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.300
That's not all. She planned
limited-edition beer with rare fruit

16:34.300 --> 16:35.700
and went trekking through jungles.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.667
Wow, is she some kind of Tarzan?

16:37.667 --> 16:40.767

Tarzan again, didn't you?

16:45.533 --> 16:48.567
Because of you, there are all
these weird rumors going around.

16:48.567 --> 16:50.200
Did I say anything that wasn't true?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.400

17:02.633 --> 17:04.668
Absolutely, you are my role model.

17:04.668 --> 17:06.332
I'm telling the truth.

17:06.332 --> 17:08.933
- Hey quiet now.
- Shut it.

17:08.933 --> 17:11.133
What? Why did everyone
suddenly stop laughing?

17:11.133 --> 17:12.700
Conference room. Now.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.700
No ideas at all?

17:14.700 --> 17:15.900
You, intern.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.133
- Yes?
- Got any brilliant ideas?

17:18.133 --> 17:20.367
They say Gen Z these days
come up with fresh, creative ideas,

17:20.367 --> 17:23.200
but I guess not all of them do.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.500
You must've learned something in a month.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.200
Didn't your supervisor teach you anything?

17:29.200 --> 17:30.700
Just scold me already.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.400
I think that's what you wanted to say to me.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.867
Fine, you talk well.

17:34.867 --> 17:36.233
Now, show me what you've got.

17:36.233 --> 17:38.733
Set an example as a senior.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.767
You think you can just sit back
now that Germany's basically a done deal?

17:43.767 --> 17:48.567
I suppose that's smarter than getting
involved and docking your own score.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.967
So, I just need to bring it
by the next meeting, right?

17:54.967 --> 17:58.867

18:03.467 --> 18:07.600
I worked all weekend because of her,
and now she's messing with my junior.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.833
Why's she always obsessed
with taking me down?

18:09.833 --> 18:13.933
<i>Because a junior who's better
than her keeps threatening her turf.</i>

18:13.933 --> 18:16.800
<i>She blames you for last year's
failed promotion, right?</i>

18:16.800 --> 18:18.167
No, that was

18:18.167 --> 18:21.467
because she tried to claim
our team's all-nighter as her work.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.800
Anyway, I stormed out in anger earlier,

18:24.800 --> 18:28.267
but where do I find such an idea?

18:28.267 --> 18:30.167

19:28.700 --> 19:30.367
It hurts.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.067

20:05.500 --> 20:07.233
Are you okay?

20:29.867 --> 20:32.133
Had a blind date over the weekend?

20:32.133 --> 20:33.700
Did Mi Ran say that?

20:33.700 --> 20:36.267
No, I was hoping the three of us
could grab a drink after so long.

20:36.267 --> 20:38.467
But she said you have a very important date.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.767
No, it's not that. Not at all.

20:41.767 --> 20:46.233
I thought maybe you'd finally
started thinking about marriage.

20:46.233 --> 20:48.167
You know how my parents are.

20:48.167 --> 20:50.167
Get out! Get out!

20:50.167 --> 20:51.667
Why should I leave? This is my house!

20:51.667 --> 20:52.833

20:52.833 --> 20:55.067
How could you do this to us?

Huh?

21:10.300 --> 21:14.033
You still think your parents' divorce
was your fault?

21:14.033 --> 21:16.100
So, why would anyone marry without love?

21:16.100 --> 21:19.733
Even if it hadn't been Dad's affair,
they would've divorced anyway.

21:19.733 --> 21:21.700
They weren't compatible.

21:21.700 --> 21:25.300
When well-matched people meet,
they might go a lifetime without fighting.

you truly love later, you won't marry?

Never mind.

21:32.533 --> 21:36.333

21:50.600 --> 21:53.867

just throw the doll away like that?

You said you'd let Mr. Lee go.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.867
- I did let him go.
- But you caused a ruckus.

51:45.867 --> 51:49.167
I said I'd let him go, but I never said
I'd give him away to someone else.

51:49.167 --> 51:50.567
If word gets out about this...

Okay, I get what you mean.

Are you sure you have
no plans to get married?

52:17.633 --> 52:20.900
Your mother keeps worrying about you.

52:20.900 --> 52:25.133
But you have no intention to do so at all.

Isn't that right?

responsibility for this?

How?

52:38.200 --> 52:40.600
How?

53:22.267 --> 53:25.467
I thought he only worked,
but apparently he does everything.

53:25.467 --> 53:27.233

Yes.

53:33.233 --> 53:36.367
What on earth was I thinking with a stranger?

But that necklace looked
like a gift for a woman.

53:53.767 --> 53:56.467
They say your proposal got approved.

53:56.467 --> 53:59.267
I mean, that logo placement!

53:59.267 --> 54:01.267
According to Manager Jang,
raising the logo placement on the glass

54:01.267 --> 54:04.200
increases the amount of beer and soju poured.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.433
If sales increase,
management won't object much.

54:07.433 --> 54:10.267
First, we'll produce a small batch
with the new print,

54:10.267 --> 54:13.308

from the beer glass manufacturer

I think it's better to raise it
just this subtly.

It is indeed an endometrial cyst.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.433
Moreover, your uterus is congenitally weak,

59:42.433 --> 59:45.667
so pregnancy might be difficult.

might be difficult for me.
