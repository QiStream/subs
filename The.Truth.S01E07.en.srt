=Episode 7=

3
00:01:18,104 --> 00:01:19,384
When we questioned Wu Da,

4
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:24,264
he admitted he was unwilling
to divorce Wang Xiaole

5
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:27,904
and he was unhappy
with her dating a new boyfriend.

6
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:28,984
By the way,

7
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:34,104
after they got married, they bought
the place at Shancheng Community.

8
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:36,264
After the divorce,
Wu Da gave it to Wang Xiaole.

9
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:38,225
Therefore, we believe

10
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,744
there's potential motivation
from a financial perspective.

11
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:45,104
But the crime scene investigation

12
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:48,344
shows no definitive evidence
of Wu Da's involvement.

13
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:51,464
At 10 PM on the night of the murder,

14
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:54,624
after Wu Da left through the north gate,

15
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,705
he never reappeared on surveillance.

16
00:01:59,184 --> 00:02:01,945
What size shoes does Wu Da wear?

17
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:02,945
Size 42.

18
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:10,385
Xiaole called me that night

19
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:11,585
and asked me to come see her.

20
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:15,585
I arrived around 9 PM.

21
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:18,464
Xiaole?

22
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:22,624
Xiaole?

23
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:27,385
Xiaole?

24
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:29,184
Xiao...

25
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:38,425
(You and Wang Xiaole are divorced.)

26
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,904
Why keep this relationship?

27
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:43,344
Xiaole and I never intended to divorce.

28
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:45,265
Our relationship was great.

29
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,705
But her parents threatened suicide
to force her to divorce me.

30
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:53,865
It's my fault too,
a man with no money or future.

31
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:55,744
(I didn't become a doctor.)

32
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:57,944
Later, I became a pharmaceutical rep
at a bad time

33
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,985
and lost a lot of money.

34
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:02,145
I couldn't provide Xiaole
a better material life.

35
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:05,145
That's why I voluntarily
gave her the place.

36
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:07,464
Although divorced,

37
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:08,464
we didn't cut ties.

38
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:11,705
We'd meet two or three times a month,

39
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:13,464
usually at hotels,

40
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:16,025
occasionally at home.

41
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:17,025
No overnight stay.

42
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:18,705
Xiaole's parents have keys.

43
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:19,585
If they caught us...

44
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:25,545
We hadn't met in the last six months.

45
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:26,904
All we had were texts

46
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:27,744
and calls.

47
00:03:28,664 --> 00:03:31,904
I knew her parents had introduced her
to someone new.

48
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:33,425
Huang Chong?

49
00:03:34,705 --> 00:03:37,464
Huang Chong outperforms me in every way.

50
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:40,145
Xiaole told me they got along well.

51
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:41,705
It was serious, leading to marriage.

52
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,224
After you had sexual intercourse
with Wang Xiaole that night,

53
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:47,784
what did you do next?

54
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,184
She took a full shower.

55
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:51,744
I just took a quick one.

56
00:03:58,664 --> 00:03:59,425
You're beautiful.

57
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:01,784
Any food? I'm hungry.

58
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,265
I'm getting married.

59
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:10,825
To that Huang Chong guy?

60
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,904
What does your family see in him?

61
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,344
He's permanent staff.

62
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:17,784
And he's reliable.

63
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,784
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

64
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:28,424
Wontons are in the kitchen.

65
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:29,864
I'll heat them for you.

66
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:30,945
No need.

67
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:37,145
I'm leaving.

68
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,825
(You left?)

69
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:42,904
What was the exact time?

70
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:43,864
10 PM.

71
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:47,745
Where did you go after leaving?

72
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:51,505
I didn't go home after leaving.

73
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:53,585
I just drank by the roadside.

74
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:54,585
Where'd you buy it?

75
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:56,904
A small supermarket there.

76
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,385
Then what?

77
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:01,145
After that,

78
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,904
I... I knew
Xiaole was marrying another man.

79
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:05,945
I was mentally prepared,

80
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:08,864
but I couldn't accept it emotionally.

81
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:10,664
I hadn't even finished half of it

82
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:11,505
before getting drunk.

83
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,784
The cool breeze later sobered me up.

84
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:14,625
So I went home.

85
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:16,424
What time was that approximately?

86
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:19,664
I really don't remember.

87
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:20,784
I was already drunk then.

88
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:24,265
Where exactly were you drinking?

89
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:25,065
The specific spot?

90
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:28,664
Left of the community's north gate,

91
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:29,984
there's a large flower bed.

92
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:30,904
From our place...

93
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:34,464
From Xiaole's place, you could see it.

94
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:47,745
Captain Leng.

95
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,745
I heard Wu Da and Wang Xiaole

96
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:09,464
stole their household registries
to marry

97
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,585
due to family opposition.

98
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,464
They clearly loved each other.

99
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:17,505
Why couldn't they stay together?

100
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,185
Life's pressures, I suppose.

101
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,344
What would you two like to order?

102
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:48,145
Sir, got a minute?

103
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,825
Did you see this person
on the night of the 9th?

104
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,625
This person? No.

105
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,705
Are you sure?

106
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:57,864
I'm sure.

107
00:06:58,424 --> 00:07:00,265
Why are you asking
about that drunkard again?

108
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:01,625
Didn't you ask the other day?

109
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:03,705
He comes often.

110
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:05,705
Every time, he buys a bottle of liquor.

111
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,224
The cheapest kind.

112
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:09,185
After buying it,

113
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:11,864
he drinks by that flower bed over there.

114
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:13,185
That one right there.

115
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,664
He can't hold his liquor,

116
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:17,984
and he's a mean drunk.

117
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,984
Whenever he drinks, he makes a scene.

118
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:22,505
Sometimes he cries.

119
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:23,864
Sometimes he howls over there.

120
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:25,424
It's terrible.

121
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,585
I heard the woman who died
in our neighborhood was his ex-wife.

122
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:35,984
Did he do it?

123
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,505
Will a death here
affect the housing prices?

124
00:07:41,825 --> 00:07:43,224
Did he come the night of the 9th?

125
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:45,025
He did.
Bought a bottle of liquor and left.

126
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:46,625
Do you remember what time he left?

127
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,424
What time?

128
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:49,904
Around after 10 PM, I think.

129
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:52,424
There were still many customers then.

130
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:55,145
Where did he go after leaving?

131
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:56,025
Did you see?

132
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:56,705
I saw him.

133
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:59,585
He went out, turned left,
and headed straight for that flower bed.

134
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:00,745
Definitely that flower bed.

135
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:11,385
It's him.

136
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:16,304
Every night when I walk my dog here,
I see him.

137
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:18,224
Drunk out of his mind.

138
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:20,664
Even my dog wants to avoid him.

139
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:24,864
You mean the 9th?
He was there that day too.

140
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:26,664
I remember it clearly.

141
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:29,224
Sir,

142
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:33,265
do you remember about what time

143
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:34,745
you saw him?

144
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:38,544
I walk my dog at fixed times every day.

145
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:39,385
Come rain or shine.

146
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:40,664
Twice a day.

147
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:42,345
One walk is at this time of day.

148
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:44,664
The other is at night.

149
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,225
I went out at 11:30 PM

150
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:49,265
and returned at 1:50 AM.

151
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:51,225
Both when I left and returned,

152
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,784
I saw him. He slumped here.

153
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,145
Are you sure it's him?

154
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,704
The lighting around here
isn't great at night.

155
00:08:59,944 --> 00:09:01,184
Could it be that you...

156
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:01,944
Young man,

157
00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:05,505
are you saying I'm old
and my eyes are failing?

158
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:07,105
It was absolutely him.

159
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:10,505
It's not like I've seen him
just once or twice.

160
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:12,745
He's here every few days.

161
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:16,824
A troubled young man, hooked on drink.

162
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,904
It's disgraceful.

163
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:20,424
Right.

164
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:21,904
I even want to teach him a lesson.

165
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:23,745
Let me tell you.

166
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:25,904
These young people today...

167
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:28,064
How should I put it?

168
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:29,225
Yeah.

169
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,625
Back in our day, right?

170
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,625
We came home right after work.

171
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:48,536
(North Gate)

172
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:11,985
Based on our neighborhood canvass,

173
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:16,544
Wu Da was drinking at the north gate
flower bed during the crime's timeframe.

174
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,904
He couldn't have killed her.

175
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:20,865
Time to eat!

176
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:23,105
Focus on identifying this person
in the surveillance.

177
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:24,904
Come on, eat first.

178
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,465
Come on, let's eat.

179
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:27,416
I'll get yours, Master.

180
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:33,225
Thank you.

181
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:35,105
Here, help yourselves.

182
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:42,664
Thanks.

183
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,345
Thank you.

184
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:46,824
Here.

185
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:48,424
Alright.

186
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,745
Okay, the chopsticks.

187
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:54,745
Ziwu.

188
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:56,184
Perfect timing. Join us.

189
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:57,304
Captain Leng,

190
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:02,225
I found small debris on the doormat
at Wang Xiaole's place earlier.

191
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,904
Tests revealed
it was fresh Masson pine bark.

192
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:09,865
North of Shancheng Community
is a large pine forest.

193
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:16,745
Neither Wu Da nor the victim's parents
have hiking habits.

194
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:18,704
The chance of them
stepping on it is very low.

195
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:25,784
And it's mostly Japanese red pine,
Chinese red pine, and Armand pine here.

196
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:27,824
Masson pines are very rare.

197
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:29,025
Especially in the urban area.

198
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:32,625
Alright, hurry up and eat.

199
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:35,544
After eating, we'll check the woods
near the victim's place.

200
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,225
Captain Sun,

201
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,025
we've been here for days now.

202
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:03,544
Why has Captain Leng
been wearing sunglasses all the time?

203
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:05,385
Look at you, Zhou.

204
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,385
What's with all the questions?

205
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,625
Captain Leng's eyes
were injured during a mission.

206
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:11,584
He avoids light.

207
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:14,465
That's why
he has to wear glasses day and night.

208
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:16,465
But they're not sunglasses.

209
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:17,584
They don't block his view.

210
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:20,105
So, you...

211
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,265
Captain Leng.

212
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:28,865
We got something.

213
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,824
The packaging colors
of these condoms are all different.

214
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,625
They weren't tossed on the same day.

215
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:41,025
Here too.

216
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:51,505
Come look at this.

217
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,304
There's a telescope here.

218
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:53,385
It offers a clear view
into the victim's bedroom.

219
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:11,385
No valuable fingerprints found
on the packaging of these four condoms.

220
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:15,265
The user was likely wearing gloves
when handling them.

221
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:19,145
I found latex and talcum powder traces
on the tree bark.

222
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:20,745
Consistent with medical gloves.

223
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:22,145
So I conclude

224
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:24,704
that the suspect
climbed the tree wearing gloves.

225
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,625
Specifically, medical latex gloves.

226
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:29,865
That matches Ye's earlier theory.

227
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:32,304
The suspect is meticulous, organized,

228
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:33,544
and highly cautious.

229
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:35,584
Given those traits, the medical gloves,

230
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:37,345
and the skill with a scalpel,

231
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:39,865
it's highly likely the suspect
has a medical background.

232
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,025
He may also have hobbies
like hiking or rock climbing.

233
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:46,424
But both Wang Xiaole and Wu Da
graduated from medical school.

234
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:48,025
And they both worked in related fields.

235
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:50,544
Within their social circles,

236
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:53,184
many are doctors
or have medical backgrounds.

237
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,225
I think that scope is still too broad.

238
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:56,064
Alright.

239
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,225
You've paid respects to my parents.

240
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:11,544
I know you don't stand on ceremony,

241
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:16,544
but this outfit

242
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:19,665
is a bit much.

243
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:23,824
(Beloved Father Chen Yiqing's Tomb
Beloved Mother Liu Rongdan's Tomb)

244
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:24,945
They are always in my heart.

245
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:28,584
The rest is just formality.

246
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,344
It's for the living to see.

247
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:34,905
Besides,

248
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:37,344
I need to stand out.

249
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,665
So they don't lose track of me.

250
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:42,425
Let's go.

251
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,505
No word from Bao Hei
these past few days.

252
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:10,225
Probably busy digging graves.

253
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,304
Once we get past this hurdle,
we'll meet Bao Hei, right?

254
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:15,544
Hard to say.

255
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:20,225
Bao Hei has a reputation
for his cold heart and cruel hands.

256
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:23,344
Earning his real trust won't be easy.

257
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:25,905
Trust from someone like him? Forget it.

258
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,465
To get him to cooperate,

259
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:30,465
we need to intimidate him.

260
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:32,104
Plainly speaking,

261
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:35,225
we're not the only source around
these days.

262
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:40,225
But an ex-boyfriend
who's an active-duty cop

263
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:43,304
is not something
just anyone can produce.

264
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:48,225
Are you sure?

265
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,985
Should you reconsider?

266
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:58,505
Dragging this out with Bao Hei
benefits no one.

267
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:01,824
Besides, he started this whole thing.

268
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:02,745
We can't avoid it.

269
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:05,544
If we avoid it,
he'll only get more suspicious.

270
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,784
We might as well go with the flow

271
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,265
and let Bao Hei see
what we're capable of.

272
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:21,945
You hate him that much?

273
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:31,505
Not running into him

274
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:33,705
all these years was fine.

275
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:36,864
But fate brought us together.

276
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,064
Well,

277
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:44,064
how could I possibly
let him get away easily

278
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:45,945
and live so happily?

279
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:13,070
(Sexual Wellness Products)

280
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:15,384
Check up ahead.

281
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:15,945
Okay.

282
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,705
Do you have this product here?

283
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:28,225
This one isn't currently sold here.

284
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:30,584
It's one
of those free contraceptive supplies.

285
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:33,864
No, we don't have this one here.

286
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:36,025
From what I know,
it's not available nearby.

287
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:37,985
Thank you.

288
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:52,425
Master,

289
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:53,824
the pharmacy staff

290
00:20:53,824 --> 00:20:55,304
said this condom isn't for sale.

291
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:58,064
It's handed out freely across the city.

292
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:02,265
Mainly at county or district
family planning departments,

293
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:04,265
hospitals, and neighborhood committees.

294
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:05,905
In that case,

295
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:11,425
we can trace the source
and look into its distribution process.

296
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:14,505
Find out which communities
and streets are involved

297
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,104
and target

298
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:18,185
units or individuals

299
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,025

300
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:21,384
Okay.

302

00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:23,185
No.

to become a police officer.

308
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:57,185
After that incident, I changed my name.

00:22:58,225 --> 00:22:59,584

310

Let's start over.

My name is Dan Qing now.

312
00:23:16,985 --> 00:23:18,425
When did you come back to Yunxi?

313
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:20,465
I returned several years ago.

314
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:23,945
I've been looking for you all along.

315
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,465

316
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:30,064

317
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,384
No, thanks.

318
00:23:33,064 --> 00:23:33,864
Are you sure?

319
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,505
I'll head out then.

320
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:47,265
Let's exchange WeChat.

321

When will you paint

338
00:25:58,544 --> 00:25:59,864
that painting you promised me?

339
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,864
Don't worry. I'm working on it.

340
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:04,465
Then when will you give it to me?

341
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:05,905
Tomorrow, the day after,

342
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:06,905
or the day after that?

343
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:10,185
I'm warning you now.

344
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:12,064
If you break your promise,

345
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:13,304
I'll never talk to you again.

346
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:16,665
Then I'll keep painting for you forever.

347
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:18,104
Until I can't hold a brush.

348

Look up someone for me.

The name's Dan Qing.

00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:23,465
Sending it now.

00:27:25,104 --> 00:27:26,265
Okay, thanks.

367
00:28:36,864 --> 00:28:41,624
Where did the bloody clothes go?

368
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:45,624
The scene was covered in blood.

369
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:49,425
But no blood on the clothes?

370
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:51,384
That's impossible.

What is it, Long?

372
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,745
That telescope
is the most common basic model.

373
00:29:09,745 --> 00:29:10,584
No fingerprints.

374
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:11,945
No DNA, nothing at all.

375
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:15,185
We can only tell
it's been there a long time.

376
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:23,344
The victim bought the resale property
when marrying four years ago.

377
00:29:24,104 --> 00:29:26,425
The suspect's been watching the victim
that long?

378
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:29,265
If that's the case,

379
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:33,985
we can exclude who Wang Xiaole and Wu Da
met in the last four years, right?

380
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:41,496
No fingerprints besides those of Wu Da,
Wang Xiaole, Huang Chong,

381
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:45,064
or the victim's parents
are found at the scene.

382
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:48,665
DNA

383
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:51,928

didn't have time to clean yet.

I won't finish early today.

387

Don't wait for me.

388
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:26,185
By the way,

389
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,505
I ordered some vegetable racks online.

390
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:29,945
Should arrive in a few days.

391
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:33,064
They've arrived?

392
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:34,505
Don't open them yet.

393
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:35,985
The screws inside are sharp.

394
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:38,265
I'll install them on the wall
when I'm home.

395
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,384
That's Captain Leng calling.

396
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:43,425
Must be work.

397
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:44,505
I need to go.

398
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,185
(Forensic Imagery Room)

399
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:49,945
Captain Leng,

400
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:55,384
I found no valuable clues
at the south gate.

401
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:56,584
Right.

402
00:30:57,344 --> 00:31:00,384
Same for the woods
outside the north gate.

403
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:02,665
Too little useful evidence.

404
00:31:02,665 --> 00:31:03,985
I'm still looking.

405
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:12,185
(Yunxi Medical University)

406
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:12,945
Ye,

407
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,985
sorry to keep you waiting.

408
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:17,225
(File Bag)
Look, these old files

409
00:31:17,465 --> 00:31:19,824
are stored
in the old teaching building's archive.

410
00:31:20,185 --> 00:31:22,784
We haven't digitized them yet.

411
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:24,425
Hence the delay.

412
00:31:24,905 --> 00:31:26,384
You're too kind, Mr. Liu.

413
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:28,784
I should thank you
for assisting our investigation.

414
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:30,384
(Graduate Registration Form)
My pleasure.

415
00:31:30,384 --> 00:31:31,425
You may not know.

416
00:31:31,784 --> 00:31:36,384
I was Wu Da and Xiaole's
homeroom teacher.

417
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:41,025
When Wu Da applied
to transfer departments,

418
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:43,304
(Wu Da's Profile)
I advised him not to act impulsively.

419
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:46,344
Ours is a top university.

420
00:31:46,544 --> 00:31:48,705
Getting into our department isn't easy.

421
00:31:49,465 --> 00:31:52,304
I advised him
to cherish this opportunity.

422
00:31:52,304 --> 00:31:55,025
But he refused on the spot.

423
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:59,584
He even said he wasn't cut out
for medicine at all,

424
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:04,344
and Xiaole was the only reason
he chose clinical.

425
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,705
- That kid...
- Sir,

426
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:07,945
based on your understanding of Wu Da,

427
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:11,225
could he achieve such precision
with the incision?

428
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:11,824
Wu Da?

429
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:15,265
He couldn't hold the scalpel properly
during training.

430
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:16,505
This photo

431
00:32:16,624 --> 00:32:19,064
shows a clean, neat incision

432
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:20,265
with perfectly even force.

433
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:23,265
Without years of practice
and solid fundamentals,

434
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:24,784
one simply couldn't have done it.

435
00:32:29,544 --> 00:32:30,144
Sir,

436
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:34,824
Wu Da received a disciplinary demerit
while at school?

437
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:39,624
It was for fighting
with another student.

438
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,384
The kids acted impulsively,

439
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:46,025
but actually,
they were very close friends.

440
00:32:46,104 --> 00:32:48,705
They were inseparable all day long.

441
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:55,985
Ye,

442
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:58,465
how are your parents doing overseas?

443
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:01,185
They're doing fine.

444
00:33:02,265 --> 00:33:04,265
When you talk to them next time,

445
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:07,104
tell them
we old friends still think of them.

446
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,784
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

447
00:33:09,185 --> 00:33:09,784
By the way,

448
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,384
could you please help me find out

449
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:14,784
the specific details
of Wu Da's fight and demerit?

450
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:18,185
No problem. I'll tell you
as soon as I find anything.

451
00:33:18,265 --> 00:33:18,864
Thank you.

452
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:20,104
Take care. I'm off.

453
00:33:20,104 --> 00:33:21,624
Alright, take care.

454
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:41,425
I went to a movie
with Little Zhao that day.

455
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:46,745
But I used your name to invite her.

456
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:48,265
You don't mind, do you?

457
00:33:51,025 --> 00:33:52,425
Can't you rely on yourself?

458
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:54,144
I do want to rely on myself, bro.

459
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:55,544
But I can't get her out like that.

460
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:56,384
She won't come.

461
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:02,784
Just tell me,

462
00:34:02,985 --> 00:34:06,784
is there even the slightest chance
between you two?

463
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:08,064
There isn't.

464
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:09,825
Okay then, that puts my mind at ease.

465
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:13,104
Actually, the atmosphere
during the movie was pretty good.

466
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,064
It looked promising.

467
00:34:15,224 --> 00:34:18,025
But unfortunately,
I had to leave halfway through.

468
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:30,584
How about doing another favor for me?

469
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:32,584
What now?

470
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,945
I invited Little Zhao
for a late-night snack.

471
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:36,785
I said you'll go too.

472
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,785
And she just replied, saying yes.

473
00:34:43,192 --> 00:34:46,985
(No-Name Diner)

474
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:47,785
Jing.

475
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:50,624
You're here. Perfect, it's all ready.

476
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:51,104
Great.

477
00:34:51,104 --> 00:34:51,744
Dig in.

478
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:52,505
- Thanks.
- Jing.

479
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:53,752
Here, Little Zhao.

480
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:54,945
Is she your girlfriend?

481
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:55,544
A friend.

482
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:56,505
- No.
- Not my girlfriend.

483
00:34:57,064 --> 00:34:58,144
- Sit.
- Eat up.

484
00:34:58,144 --> 00:34:59,305
Holler if you need me.

485
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,264
Got it.

486
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:03,825
So this is the amazing restaurant
you keep mentioning?

487
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:05,785
The place looks pretty ordinary.

488
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,184
And the dishes
seem like regular home cooking.

489
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:10,544
Let me try this.

490
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:12,385
That's delicious.

491
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,785
I think it's quite tasty.

492
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:15,785
Better than my cooking.

493
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:17,345
It's good.

494
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:18,985
If you say it's good, then it is.

495
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:24,465
Tasty.

496
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:37,264
Captain Qin, you're here.

497
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:37,905
Is it ready?

498
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:38,664
All ready.

499
00:35:38,664 --> 00:35:39,624
Come on in and sit down.

500
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:41,505
I'll serve the noodles right away.
Just sit.

501
00:35:41,624 --> 00:35:42,425
- Okay.
- Right away.

502
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:43,144
- Jing.
- Come on.

503
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:44,865
What's going on?

504
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:46,104
Serve the noodles, Shan.

505
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:47,264
Qian.

506
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:49,224
Long.

507
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:50,025
Serve the noodles.

508
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:50,985
Long, you're here too.

509
00:35:51,104 --> 00:35:51,664
You're here.

510
00:35:51,664 --> 00:35:52,184
Enjoy.

511
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,465
Qian and Long, you're here too.

512
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:56,025
- You're here.
- You must be starving.

513
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:56,704
Eat your food.

514
00:35:56,704 --> 00:35:57,305
Here.

515
00:35:57,945 --> 00:35:59,104
- Free noodles.
- Qian. Long.

516
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,704
Come on.

517
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:01,305
Everyone, eat up.

518
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:03,385
- Noodles.
- Serve this table.

519
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:04,144
Here.

520
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:04,825
Coming right up.

521
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:09,744
Here.

522
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:12,184
Give this to them first.

523
00:36:15,064 --> 00:36:16,704
How about we find another place?

524
00:36:17,184 --> 00:36:17,985
What's wrong?

525
00:36:18,825 --> 00:36:23,025
I feel creeped out even though
I haven't done anything wrong.

526
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:23,905
It's no big deal.

527
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:25,144
They're the Public Order Unit.

528
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:26,505
The power of justice.

529
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,465
There must be another operation tonight.

530
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:30,584
There's an operation?

531
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:45,385
(Team One, Team One.)

532
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:46,664
(Team Two, Team Two, move out.)

533
00:36:47,064 --> 00:36:47,905
Copy. Moving out.

534
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:48,945
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

535
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:49,465
- Copy that.
- Move.

536
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:49,985
Let's go.

537
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:50,744
Let's go.

538
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:52,184
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

539
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:23,865
What's happening tonight?

540
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:24,865
Why the rush?

541
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:27,345
Liu and Shan, come here.

542
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:28,905
Clean those up.

543
00:37:28,905 --> 00:37:30,425
They probably won't be back soon.

544
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,465
Grab that bucket.

545
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:35,785
Pour everything into the bucket

546
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,505
for the stray cats, dogs, and such.

547
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:40,264
Look at them.

548
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:41,624
Put it on the table for now.

549
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:49,224
- Hello, Master.
- Hello, Lei.

550
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:53,985
Coming.

551
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,232
(No-Name Diner)

552
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:04,584
What's going on tonight?

553
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:08,305
Just sit.

554
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:11,465
You'll get used to it.

555
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:15,664
That's the nature of their job.
They leave at a moment's notice.

556
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:19,264
How about I join you?

557
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:20,664
Or it'll all go to waste.

558
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:21,345
Okay.

559
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:22,664
Let's eat.

560
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:27,264
Ms. Jing,

561
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:30,905
does Ye Qian come here often?

562
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:33,505
He comes often.

563
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:42,264
Has he brought other girls here before?

564
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,985
Anyway, you're the first girl
they've brought here.

565
00:38:54,945 --> 00:38:55,505
Ms. Jing,

566
00:38:56,144 --> 00:38:58,584
is your family in the same line of work?

567
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:03,025
My husband, Jiao Lei,
is their colleague.

568
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:03,985
He's also a cop.

569
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:07,184
My son used to be a soldier.

570
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:08,465
A border guard.

571
00:39:09,064 --> 00:39:09,865
That's cool.

572
00:39:10,825 --> 00:39:12,224
Quite a handsome young man.

573
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:14,664
Lots of girls liked him.

574
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:20,905
But he died on duty five years ago.

575
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:26,704
I've worked in food service
since before my son.

576
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:30,025
I wanted to open my own restaurant

577
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,025
to honor my son

578
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:34,064
and keep myself occupied.

579
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:38,985
Jiao's unit was setting up a canteen
for field personnel back then,

580
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:41,064
and the leaders sympathized with me,

581
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,744
so they gave us priority

582
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,345
and hence this restaurant.

583
00:39:45,465 --> 00:39:48,144
We sometimes provide meals
for sanitation workers.

584
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:49,465
It's volunteer-based too.

585
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:55,945
People need something to hold onto.

586
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:58,785
It feels good to do something
for that purpose.

587
00:39:59,624 --> 00:40:02,704
Can I come help next time then?

588
00:40:04,144 --> 00:40:05,184
Of course.

589
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,785
You're welcome.

590
00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:07,785
Alright.

591
00:40:08,744 --> 00:40:09,544
Eat more.

592
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:12,544
You eat too.

593
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:15,505
Slow down.

594
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:45,785
Is this the old chemical factory's
discharge pool?

595
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:47,305
Why the strong smell?

596
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:52,744
This whole area
used to be a chemical factory.

597
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,064
Later, the factory relocated.
The land was sold.

598
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:56,544
It's been left abandoned ever since.

599
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:59,025
Now it's entirely a garbage dump.

600
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,385
If it hadn't become a dump,

601
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,224
I wouldn't have found this place.

602
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:06,144
See that surveillance camera?

603
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:10,584
Coming through the woods,
there's only this one camera.

604
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:12,425
The camera was installed

605
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:16,905
by the city sanitation department
to catch trucks illegally dumping trash.

606
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:18,505
Didn't expect it
to help us out big time.

607
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:24,584
Is the person
who threw something into the pond

608
00:41:24,704 --> 00:41:28,785
the same one who appeared
at the south gate of the community?

609
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:29,985
Looks like it.

610
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:36,224
But the camera's resolution is lacking.

611
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:37,865
We need to analyze it thoroughly.

612
00:42:03,985 --> 00:42:04,825
Found it.

613
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:08,385
Found it.
