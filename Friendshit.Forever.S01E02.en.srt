You walked all the way here
just to walk me home?

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,126
I just don't feel like talking to him.

145
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:03,930
He talks nonstop. I can't keep up.

146
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,990
True.

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,806
But it's not like you don't like him, right?

148
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,278
Nah, I'm neutral.

He seems like a decent guy.

157

Yeah.

Yeah.

161
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:10,190
Okay, but if it gets serious,

162
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,414
I'll take you to get birth control myself.

164
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,334

I'll take you to buy condoms.

165

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,294
You're like the sister I always wanted.

169
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,550
That deep?

170
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,010
Yeah.

171
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,210
Then call me "P'Baikhaw."

172
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,860
Yes, P'Baikhaw.

173
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,006
Ugh, gross.

174
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,820
Tao, off to school already?

175
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,350
Come have some porridge first.

176
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,920
Come on, have a little, dear.

177
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,660
Okay, fine.
I just wanted to beat the traffic.

178
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,470
Just eat first.

179
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,342
- Sure.
- Sit down.

180
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,710
Busy with school lately?

181
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,450
You haven't been home much.

182
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,262
I've been studying with friends
at their dorms,

183
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:25,034
so I might as well stay there.

184
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,120
Do what you want.

185
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,214
Just don't lose that scholarship.

186
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,230
I know, Dad.

187
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,126
Dear, trust him a little, will you?

188
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,782
Don't mind your dad's nagging.

189
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:45,580
I trust you, Tao.

190
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,150
Oh! Your aunt asked if you tutor.

191
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,430
She wanted her daughter
to get a scholarship too.

192
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,190
See?

193
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,278
Everyone wants to be like you.

194
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,390
All scholarship kids
got bright futures ahead of them.

195
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,686
I'm done, Mom, Dad.

196
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:11,990
I'm heading out.

197
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,470
- That's all you're eating?
- See you.

198
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,280
Yeah, I'm full.

199
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,678
See you.

200
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,694
Hey, Namo!

201
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,250
Damn you, Tao!

202
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,374
Where are Baikhaw and Tulip?

203
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:37,070
Haven't seen them yet.

204
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,886
I've got a study session with Tulip.
Come with us?

205
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:44,210
Nah, you go ahead.

206
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,438
Are you mad at me or something?

207
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,542
No, I'm not.

208
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,734
Wait... you like Tulip or what?

209
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,260
Why?

210
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,790
'Cause I'm thinking of asking her out.

211
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,518
Then go ahead.

212
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,790
Glad you're not bothered by it.

213
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,070
Just one thing.

214
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,750
What?

215
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,254
You sure you actually like her?

216
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,110
I really do.

217
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,990
Then you'd better mean it.

218
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,582
Hey, where are you going?

219
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,590
Namo!

220
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,590
Tulip.

221
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,950
Tulip.

222
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,710
You...

223
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,113
Mom!

224
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:23,422
- Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
- This...

225
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:29,200
Oh, this is my friend Baikhaw.

226
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,374
I'm her roommate.

227
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,574
Since when did you get a roommate?

228
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:46,610
Why didn't I know?

229
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,530
It's been a while, Mom.

230
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,330
Have you known each other long?

231
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:56,280
Well, since the start of the semester.

232
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,702
So, not that long then.

233
00:15:58,702 --> 00:16:00,166
And you trust her?

234
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,200
Of course I do.

235
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,060
She's the only one I really trust.

236
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,430
With Baikhaw here, I'm not lonely.

237
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
If you say so, I'll believe you.

238
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,650
It's probably for the best.

239
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,478
Having someone with you makes it safer.

240
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,760
Yeah.

241
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,006
So, this Saturday,
can you come home and stay the night?

242
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:30,970
I'll cook something nice for you.

243
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,370
- This Saturday?
- Yeah.

244
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,760
I'm not sure. I might have too much work.

245
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,558
Tulip.

246
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,694
You haven't been home in ages.

247
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:46,358
Your dad misses you.

248
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,662
He's been trying to call every day.

249
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:50,810
He can't reach you.

250
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,270
And you actually believe him?

251
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,050
I think he's just too ashamed.

252
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,130
Too afraid to call me.

253
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,118
Ashamed of what?

254
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,006
Well...

255
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,180
The day I came home,

256
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,166
I saw dad with your secretary.

257
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,370
So you saw it.

258
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,582
You knew?

259
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,446
How are you okay with that?

260
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,530
I'm not okay with it.

261
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,038
But there's nothing I can do.

262
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,850
It makes him happy.

263
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,078
He's always stressed from work...

264
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:42,750
His happiness is cheating on you
and screwing around?

265
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,518
What about our happiness?

266
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:45,950
Tulip.

267
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,250
- Don't talk about your father like that.
- Why not?

268
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,566
I don't get what's going through your mind.

269
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:52,950
How can you stand by him?

270
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,500
How can you make it seem normal?

271
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,934
Because protecting our family matters more.

272
00:17:57,934 --> 00:17:59,918
You call this protecting the family?

273
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:03,174
You're just protecting him.

274
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,670
Tulip.

275
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,170
Let's talk about this at home.

276
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,920
I'm not going.

277
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,400
Dad said it himself. He only stayed for me.

278
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,006
But now I'm gone.

279
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:18,118
So he can screw whoever he wants.

280
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:19,278
I don't care anymore.

281
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:21,006
Tulip!

282
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,170
Please, just go.

283
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,662
I see you like this,

284
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:32,460
and it hurts worse
than finding out about Dad.

285
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,410
Tulip.

286
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,414
I'm sorry, Mom.

287
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,742
But I'm not ready to talk yet.

288
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,670
Namo!

289
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,080
Where'd you go?

290
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,850
Just got lost in thought.

291
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,998
I noticed back in the lab.

292
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:52,030
You didn't finish your work today, right?

293
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,830
Something wrong?

294
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,550
Well...

295
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,840
I just had a fight with my mom.

296
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,610
So I can't really focus right now.

297
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,094
But I'll be fine soon.

298
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,702
Was it bad?

299
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,540
Yeah, pretty bad.

300
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,210
I feel guilty and awful.

301
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,190
But what's worse is... this.

302
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,840
No matter how much I read, it won't stick.

303
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,820
Then... how about this?

304
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,038
I'll tutor you.

305
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:28,760
I've already finished reading.

306
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,240
Whoa.

307
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,526
You're so nice.

308
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:34,210
You're like the ultimate friend.

309
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,382
- Thanks.
- No problem.

310
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,702
Hey, Tulip!

311
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:41,790
Why didn't you ask me to join you?

312
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,518
Sit there.

313
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,280
I thought you had class after this.

314
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,510
Nope. Wait, what are you reading?

315
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,090
Oh!

316
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,990
That quiz next week, right?

317
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,300
- Yeah.
- Want me to help you study?

318
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,022
You finished reading already?

319
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:00,220
Well, just once.

320
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,158
But if I tutor you,
it will help me review it too.

321
00:21:05,158 --> 00:21:06,850
I see.

322
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,960
So you're not confident, huh?

323
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,294
I've read it three times already.

324
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,278
Last class, you were asleep, remember?

325
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,630
Still, I think I'll be fine.

326
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,130
"You think"?

327
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,078
That means you're not sure.

328
00:21:31,702 --> 00:21:35,598
Then tomorrow you can tutor me, Tao.

329
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:36,702
I should head to class now.

330
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:38,974
I'll go with you.

331
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:42,140
Hey, Ultimate Friend, put this away for us.

332
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,734
Let's go.

333
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,100
Tulip.

334
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,246
Wawwa.

335
00:21:57,246 --> 00:22:00,230
I was just about to message you.

336
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,450
Hey.

337
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,211
The audition results
for that short film you auditioned for...

338
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:06,850
they're out.

339
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,960
So? How'd it go?

340
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,850
You didn't get the part.

341
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,398
- Sorry.
- Oh, that's fine.

342
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,622
I just did it for fun.

343
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:20,570
There's something I have to tell you.

344
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:24,000
Do you know who did get it?

345
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,550
Who?

346
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,720
[I have to go see my mom today]

347
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,720
- Baikhaw.
- Yes.

348
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,048
Wait a sec. The crew's not all here yet.

349
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:38,200
- We'll go over shooting schedules.
- Okay.

350
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,720
I'm surprised you came to audition.

351
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,740
Last time you didn't seem interested.

352
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,160
Now I believe

353
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,320
that every couple has a red thread
tied around their pinkies.

354
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,344
It ties two hearts together.

355
00:22:57,638 --> 00:23:00,208
I just changed my mind.

356
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,064
It seemed fun.

357
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,748
Baikhaw? Seriously?

358
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:19,268
This doesn't seem like her thing at all.

359
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:20,988
I know, right?

360
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:24,384
But listen.
I'm not trying to badmouth your friend.

361
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:26,928
But don't you think it's weird?

362
00:23:26,928 --> 00:23:28,792
Weird how?

363
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:34,788
So, the other day,
I came to watch you audition.

364
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:39,298
I just wondered how you know who fits a role.

365
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:42,378
Mainly by acting skill, of course.

366
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,264
Oh.

367
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:48,264
But if...

368
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:53,188
Someone's never acted before...

369
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,000
Does that mean they can't do it...

370
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,776
if it's a tough role?

371
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:06,464
There's a first time for everyone.

372
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:10,968
These things...

373
00:24:13,344 --> 00:24:15,232
can be taught, you know.

374
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:27,192
And you think...

375
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:30,304
someone like me...

376
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:35,848
could be taught?

377
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,138
And another thing.

378
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,912
Remember that guy Q?

379
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:47,178
That leaked clip of him
with some girl in a car?

380
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:48,936
Yeah, why?

381
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:53,240
That night,
someone saw that the girl was Baikhaw.

382
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,784
What?

383
00:24:55,988 --> 00:24:57,708
No way.

384
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:01,776
That night, she told me
she was taking care of her mom.

385
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:04,028
She even asked me to cover her lab work.

386
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:07,872
Come on, you sure you can trust her?

387
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:11,428
Of course! Why would she lie to me?

388
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:15,328
And besides, she doesn't even like Q.

389
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:19,468
Tulip, you just met her.

390
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:22,578
How do you know you can trust her?

391
00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:27,224
Also, are you sure
she didn't dump you with that lab work

392
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:29,064
because she was with Q?

393
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:48,096
I'm back.

394
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:53,908
How's your mom doing?

395
00:25:53,908 --> 00:25:55,864
She's okay.

396
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:08,112
What's her illness, if I may ask?

397
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:15,064
I just knew she was sick
but never what it was.

398
00:26:17,228 --> 00:26:19,864
Chronic kidney disease.

399
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:23,584
I take her for dialysis all the time.

400
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:29,024
Why do you ask?

401
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:35,998
Nothing, just wondering. Maybe I could help.

402
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:40,712
You've done enough already.
I don't know how to repay you.

403
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:43,960
I'm gonna take a shower.

404
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:40,376
All done?

405
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:41,976
Yeah.

406
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:48,988
Hungry? Wanna order something?

407
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:52,416
I knew you'd be hungry.
I bought you porridge.

408
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:55,384
You know me too well.

409
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:57,216
I'll go eat first.

410
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,668
Tao!

411
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,478
You scared me.

412
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:34,308
What's up? You look spaced out.
Something bothering you?

413
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:37,872
Just got something on my mind.

414
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:40,188
Hey, Tao.

415
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:42,528
Have you ever visited Baikhaw's mom?

416
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:45,298
Nope. Why?

417
00:28:46,498 --> 00:28:49,828
I'm just a bit worried about her mom.

418
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:54,228
Lately, she's been coming back home late.

419
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:57,608
You lonely? Call me anytime.

420
00:28:57,608 --> 00:28:59,028
I'll take you out.

421
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,056
I'm not lonely.

422
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:04,928
But honestly,

423
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:07,658
I'm kinda curious about something.

424
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,280
What is it?

425
00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:20,388
Well, I just found out
Baikhaw auditioned for the same role as me.

426
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:22,528
And she got the part.

427
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,200
But I'm not fussed or anything.

428
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,606
It's just...

429
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:31,358
Why'd she have to keep it a secret from me?

430
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:35,876
She probably just did it for fun,
and didn't expect to get it.

431
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:38,708
Maybe she didn't think
she needed to tell you.

432
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:46,138
But there's something else.

433
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:52,088
One night, she told me
she had to take care of her mom suddenly.

434
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:55,258
So she asked me to cover her lab work.

435
00:29:55,258 --> 00:29:59,464
But someone said they saw her with Q
that night.

436
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,568
It's just kinda weird.

437
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,616
- Q? Really?
- Yeah.

438
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:08,576
Sounds like people are just gossiping.

439
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:11,040
Baikhaw wouldn't do that, Tulip.

440
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:18,988
I'm not sure either,
but it was Wawwa who told me.

441
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:22,788
She's got no reason to lie.

442
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:26,178
And did Wawwa see it herself?

443
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:28,776
No, she heard it from someone else.

444
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:31,352
- Still weird though, right?
- That's what I mean.

445
00:30:31,352 --> 00:30:34,376
I don't know if you can trust Wawwa.

446
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:37,520
But I trust Baikhaw.

447
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:41,256
If you really want to know the truth,

448
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,028
you should ask Baikhaw directly.

449
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:49,432
Listening to people's gossips
isn't really good for you.

450
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:53,496
Yeah, you're right.

451
00:30:53,496 --> 00:30:56,528
I'll ask Baikhaw myself.

452
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:57,988
Don't overthink it.

453
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:00,416
Come on, there's a quiz soon.

454
00:31:02,868 --> 00:31:03,944
Wait, there's this too?

455
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:05,728
Yeah.

456
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:10,738
Looks delicious. Careful!

457
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:13,784
- Let's see.
- My own soup recipe.

458
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:18,728
Ouch!

459
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:20,568
- Hot!
- Okay.

460
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:21,928
It's good though! Really good.

461
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:24,698
If you like it, I'll cook for you again.

462
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:44,788
Hey, that short film I auditioned for...

463
00:31:44,788 --> 00:31:46,246
- The results came out.
- Really?

464
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:48,018
Yeah.

465
00:31:48,018 --> 00:31:49,998
I didn't make it.

466
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:51,238
What?

467
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:52,478
How come?

468
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,760
They picked someone else.

469
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:01,104
You know who?

470
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,768
Who?

471
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,856
You.

472
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:22,288
Why didn't you tell me you auditioned?

473
00:32:43,568 --> 00:32:45,158
Hello?

474
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:49,048
Hi Tulip, I'm the director of the short film
you auditioned for the other day.

475
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:50,158
Yes?

476
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:51,968
I just wanted to apologize.

477
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,106
The clip from your audition got corrupted.

478
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,840
We couldn't open it.

479
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,358
Could you come re-audition for me?

480
00:32:58,358 --> 00:33:02,040
But didn't you already give that role
to Baikhaw?

481
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,398
That must be a misunderstanding.

482
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:08,616
I asked her for a different role,
not the one you auditioned for.

483
00:33:10,358 --> 00:33:11,992
Oh, really?

484
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:35,936
He called and explained.

485
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:39,737
Hey, if you're not okay with it,
I can drop out.

486
00:33:39,737 --> 00:33:42,713
No, I'm fine.

487
00:33:43,828 --> 00:33:45,064
I just wondered.

488
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,208
Why didn't you tell me?

489
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,528
No, I didn't mean to hide it.

490
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:55,064
I wasn't trying to keep it secret
or anything, but...

491
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:58,668
I just wanted to try it.

492
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:01,784
You said it was fun. I wanted to try it out.

493
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:07,736
The reason I didn't tell you was...

494
00:34:08,538 --> 00:34:11,480
I wanted to surprise you.

495
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,992
Thought we could do something fun together.

496
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,808
I'm sorry.
I may be the only one who thinks this is fun.

497
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:25,800
No, no, don't. You don't need to apologize.

498
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:29,744
I should be the one apologizing.

499
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:35,456
I'm sorry.

500
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:41,016
I know you.

501
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:45,880
I shouldn't have listened to anyone else.

502
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:53,400
Who told you?

503
00:34:57,978 --> 00:34:59,568
Wawwa told me.

504
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:03,680
But I think she just heard it wrong too.

505
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:08,000
What else did she say?

506
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:11,500
She told me

507
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,240
that night you said
you were with your mom...

508
00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:19,398
someone saw you with Q.

509
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:20,668
And you believed that?

510
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,638
I didn't believe it.

511
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:24,008
That's why I came to ask.

512
00:35:24,008 --> 00:35:28,868
Seriously, don't you ever doubt
what she says?

513
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:30,238
Why?

514
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:32,008
Remember when she invited you out?

515
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:35,304
She left you alone with Q
and almost got in trouble.

516
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:37,458
She didn't even apologize.

517
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,888
Now she's trying to pit us
against each other. It's weird.

518
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:43,928
Honestly? I don't think she's a good friend.

519
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:46,216
What are you trying to say?

520
00:35:46,216 --> 00:35:48,784
I'm just saying. She's your friend, not mine.

521
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:51,998
You decide for yourself

522
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:56,628
whether what that bitch says can be trusted.

523
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:00,458
Hey!

524
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,080
Hey!

525
00:36:10,948 --> 00:36:13,416
Okay, I'll wait in the staff room.

526
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:16,828
Whoever finishes last,
come and get me to lock up.

527
00:36:16,828 --> 00:36:18,472
Alright.

528
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:25,548
Hey, Wawwa, are you done yet?

529
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:26,656
Not yet.

530
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:27,974
Then I'm heading out.

531
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:30,508
Got a date with my man.

532
00:36:30,508 --> 00:36:31,816
Sure, go.

533
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:35,512
I'll just stand here developing film alone
like an idiot.

534
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:38,264
Bye, idiot.

535
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,768
Bye! Can't get out of here fast enough, huh?

536
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,120
[Where are you?
Want to walk back together?]

537
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:36,328
Tulip, you're still here.

538
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:39,108
- Yeah.
- The library's about to close.

539
00:37:39,108 --> 00:37:40,624
I'm waiting for Baikhaw.

540
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:43,128
Don't know where she went.
She won't answer her phone.

541
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,352
She probably went home a while ago.

542
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:47,418
Didn't even show up for the evening class.

543
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:49,640
- Really?
- Yeah.

544
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:54,744
Where could she be?

545
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:57,548
I'll walk you to your condo.

546
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,760
Okay.

547
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,984
Tulip, Professor Ice wants to see you.

548
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:42,624
Where's Khemika?

549
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:45,576
Is something wrong, Professor?

550
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:48,778
I couldn't reach her.

551
00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:50,070
Thipayamas,

552
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,568
someone said you did a classmate's lab
for money.

553
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:55,758
Is that true?

554
00:39:55,758 --> 00:39:57,318
No, that's not true.

555
00:39:57,318 --> 00:39:59,188
What about Khemika's lab?

556
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,432
Did you do it for her?

557
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,968
No, I didn't.

558
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:08,848
Once we're able to reach Khemika,

559
00:40:08,848 --> 00:40:15,398
I'll have her answer a few questions
to see if you're lying.

560
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:19,800
And if I catch you lying,
you both will lose all your marks.

561
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,840
[Baikhaw]

562
00:40:27,576 --> 00:40:29,376
Come on, pick up.

563
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,120
Namo, where's Tulip?

564
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,858
Inside.

565
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:35,358
Why aren't you going in?

566
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:37,336
I...

567
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,808
What is it, Kongphop?

568
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:43,448
Hello, Professor.

569
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:48,588
I was the one who did Khemika's lab.

570
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:53,388
Her mom's sick,
so she had to take her to the hospital.

571
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:56,198
I felt bad,
so I volunteered to do it for her.

572
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:58,008
Sorry, Professor.

573
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:00,988
You're sure about that, Kongphop?

574
00:41:00,988 --> 00:41:02,208
I'm sure.

575
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,648
I'm a scholarship student.

576
00:41:03,648 --> 00:41:05,748
If I hadn't done it,

577
00:41:05,748 --> 00:41:08,752
I wouldn't lie
and risk losing my scholarship.

578
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:19,878
Why'd you tell the professor that?

579
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,408
Hey, don't worry.

580
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,264
You should just go rest.

581
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,318
How can I not worry?

582
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,998
You lost points
even though you did nothing wrong.

583
00:41:31,998 --> 00:41:34,567
Honestly, I thought I'd lose more.

584
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:37,007
At least the professor understood.

585
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:42,538
Don't worry. I'll make it up by midterms.

586
00:41:42,538 --> 00:41:44,376
It's me you're talking to.

587
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:49,578
You didn't have to go that far.

588
00:41:49,578 --> 00:41:51,673
For you.

589
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:53,865
Nothing's too far.

590
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:57,578
Whatever I can do for you,

591
00:41:57,578 --> 00:41:59,816
I'll do it without hesitation.

592
00:42:06,198 --> 00:42:11,704
The reason I did it is because
I don't want to see you so stressed.

593
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,088
Hello, Wawwa?

594
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:45,784
Huh?

595
00:42:47,588 --> 00:42:49,188
Wawwa?

596
00:42:49,188 --> 00:42:50,758
Tulip.

597
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:55,558
Wawwa, are you okay?

598
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:58,508
Are you hurt? Who did this to you?

599
00:42:58,508 --> 00:42:59,840
I don't know. It was dark.

600
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,398
I couldn't see anything.

601
00:43:03,398 --> 00:43:07,552
Calm down. I'll take you to the police.

602
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:11,044
Can you remember anything?

603
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:14,760
I... I can't remember anything.

604
00:43:16,072 --> 00:43:18,648
But when I fought back,

605
00:43:18,648 --> 00:43:21,720
I splashed chemical fluid on his inner leg.

606
00:43:27,628 --> 00:43:29,984
His inner leg?

607
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:32,768
Yeah. He's probably burned.

608
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:39,338
How bad was the burn you mentioned?

609
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:44,998
It wasn't too bad. I just threw it randomly.

610
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:49,072
But I think it left red marks.

611
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,008
Just red marks?

612
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:55,832
Yeah, maybe a few blisters.

613
00:43:55,832 --> 00:43:59,268
It's okay. Calm down.

614
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:01,384
It was so scary.

615
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,078
You're back.

616
00:44:11,078 --> 00:44:13,268
I was so worried. I couldn't reach you.

617
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:16,200
Yeah, my phone died.

618
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:20,128
Where were you?

619
00:44:20,128 --> 00:44:23,224
Are you my friend or my mom?

620
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:25,608
I'm just worried.

621
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:29,912
I went to the hospital with my mom.

622
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:33,678
She had an appointment.

623
00:44:33,678 --> 00:44:36,232
I left early before traffic got bad.

624
00:44:43,428 --> 00:44:45,378
You just got back?

625
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:49,312
Yeah, I took Wawwa to the police station.

626
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:55,280
Oh? Why?

627
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:01,408
She was assaulted at school.

628
00:45:03,608 --> 00:45:07,056
What? Is she okay?

629
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:09,618
She's hurt.

630
00:45:11,328 --> 00:45:13,524
It was pretty bad.

631
00:45:13,524 --> 00:45:17,496
But she's mostly traumatized.

632
00:45:17,496 --> 00:45:20,228
We'll check the CCTV tomorrow.

633
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:24,928
That's terrifying.

634
00:45:24,928 --> 00:45:26,952
Go shower first.

635
00:45:26,952 --> 00:45:29,048
I'll tell you everything after.

636
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:30,664
Sure.

637
00:45:38,788 --> 00:45:40,728
Shit!

638
00:45:41,578 --> 00:45:43,228
Let me help.

639
00:45:43,228 --> 00:45:44,760
Ouch!

640
00:45:49,048 --> 00:45:51,298
What happened to you?

641
00:45:51,298 --> 00:45:53,808
I spilled some chemicals at home.

642
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,498
What happened to you?

643
00:46:14,498 --> 00:46:16,680
I spilled some chemicals at home.

644
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,868
You better watch your back.

645
00:46:18,868 --> 00:46:24,148
Your current BFF is a snake.

646
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,748
I don't want to wait anymore.

647
00:46:26,748 --> 00:46:28,778
Tulip, will you go out with me?

648
00:46:28,778 --> 00:46:31,080
Have you seen Tulip? She's in danger!

649
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,432
I'll help you look for her.

650
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:36,968
You know about it already, don't you?
