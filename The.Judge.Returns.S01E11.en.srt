1
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,992
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,089
How is it?

3
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,426
To have returned to a world you wanted
in your past life?

4
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,019
Choi Yun-sun,
the Minister of Land and Transport?

5
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:29,023
I'll make sure homes are no longer bought
solely for speculation.

6
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,486
As long as I, Choi Yun-sun,
am the Minister of Land and Transport

7
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,823
the green belt will not be harmed
without permission.

8
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,618
Until the day I resign

9
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:44,121
I vow to be a public servant

10
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,374
who causes no shame.

11
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:53,047
She'll join us from today.

12
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:59,845
NEW CITY PLANNING FOR HANYANG
AND CLEARING OF THE GREEN BELT IN 2027

13
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,263
MINISTRY OF LAND AND TRANSPORT

14
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,900
I can't believe she's leaking
a public project like this!

15
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:17,321
The government will make
an official announcement next fall.

16
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,281
The Presidential election is before that.

17
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,077
Will this plan go forward,
even with a new President?

18
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:28,499
It doesn't matter who the President is.

19
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:30,710
The true President of Korea is here

20
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,753
at Suojae, after all.

21
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,883
Come on. What are you doing?

22
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,679
Our Minister of Land and Transport brought
an amazing gift for us.

23
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,557
We have to build condos, bridges

24
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,142
and buildings, you know?

25
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,309
A round of applause!

26
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,945
And everyone, take your bags.

27
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,029
Go ahead.

28
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,283
Hold on.

29
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:05,494
This is Mr. Kang. Say hi.

30
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,832
Help her out when she needs.

31
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,835
Sin-jin and Gwang-to.

32
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,754
I must stop both of them

33
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,298
or the country's justice
will be gone for good.

34
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:22,636
EPISODE 11

35
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,430
All the special activity funds from today

36
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,391
will be invested into Hanyang City.

37
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,726
Yes, which is why

38
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:33,606
I've told all conglomerate executives
to prepare money for the campaign.

39
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,858
Is that enough?

40
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:39,779
Whatever the excuse

41
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,574
talk to the President's office
to draw up the supplementary budget.

42
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:45,451
Well...

43
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:50,080
the opposition is waiting to strike
with a special activity funds audit.

44
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,874
It's not as easy as it sounds.

45
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,794
How can you handle an election
if you're so scared?

46
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:58,005
Increase the budget
for the special activity fund.

47
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,674
When the proposal reaches the assembly

48
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,843
just offer the opposition something
in return.

49
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,263
Don't let them decrease
a penny of the special activity fund.

50
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,515
Do you understand?

51
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:09,725
Yes, Mr. President.

52
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:16,315
I let you be the party leader.
It's about time you get to work.

53
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,025
I apologize.

54
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:21,278
You can go.

55
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,934
Have a seat.

56
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,406
Does Your Young Honor realize

57
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:08,826
where he is right now?

58
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,582
Look at that.

59
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:20,045
You had the chance
to become the Chief Justice

60
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,089
yet you couldn't even watch your son.

61
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,508
I apologize.

62
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,636
In fact, I've come here

63
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,639
to talk to you about that.

64
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,392
You're retired now.
What more is there to say?

65
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,812
This was 15 years ago

66
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,356
but I colluded with S Construction

67
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,276
and framed an evicted resident
as a victim.

68
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,445
Are you here for a confessional?

69
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,488
Because that's for a priest, not me.

70
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,032
But

71
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,201
the child of that evictee

72
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,370
became a judge.

73
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,916
What?

74
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,085
It's all because of that very judge

75
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,339
that my son suddenly confessed,
leading me to resign.

76
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,801
So, who is that?

77
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,097
Judge Lee Han-young

78
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,350
under Sin-jin.

79
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,518
Mr. Kang told me

80
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,729
this was where people really worked
for the nation.

81
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:23,317
I'd like to contribute
to the work for the nation.

82
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:33,369
Judge Lee, who'd returned for revenge was

83
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:36,622
more manipulative than a snake
and without mercy.

84
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:39,249
If Sin-jin ever brings him to you

85
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,417
do not trust him

86
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:43,170
no matter what.

87
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,966
A rookie judge made a Justice resign

88
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,676
and Sin-jin is

89
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,011
behind all that?

90
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,264
I'd like to suggest
Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

91
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,854
But he recommended Nam-yong to my face.

92
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,776
What is he

93
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:08,112
trying to pull here?

94
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:19,373
We built Suojae as the shadow government
before the end of Mr. Park's term.

95
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,126
How does it feel?

96
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,713
To have seen the real powerhouse of Korea.

97
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,343
It was thrilling.

98
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,345
"Thrilling"?

99
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,265
Interesting.

100
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,185
I guess I was like you, too.

101
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,230
I have a question.

102
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,693
Why did you take me there?

103
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,197
Are you asking if I trust you that much?

104
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,118
No.

105
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,872
I didn't bring you there
because I trusted you.

106
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:02,666
I brought you there so you'd trust me.

107
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,127
This is real power.

108
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:08,338
So, trust and follow my lead.

109
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:13,635
The Minister of Land and Transport leaked
a government proposal

110
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,222
which the leader of Suojae is using
to embezzle public funds.

111
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,809
Suojae has become an ugly cartel
of power and money.

112
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,105
I'll get rid of Gwang-to,
the crazy shaman believer

113
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,107
and become the leader of Suojae.

114
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,360
When the day comes

115
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,573
I'll need someone to establish
new justice with me.

116
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,160
Someone

117
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,622
who will never betray me.

118
00:10:08,857 --> 00:10:10,192
What is justice

119
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:14,530
to you?

120
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,292
The devil works quickly and clearly.

121
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,961
Nothing ever hinders it.

122
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,755
But justice needs formality
and a proper procedure.

123
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,092
So, it feels lazy, slow

124
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:36,885
and delayed.

125
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,346
The justice that I want

126
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,682
works clearly and quicker than the devil.

127
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,392
And it can't be hindered by anything.

128
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,437
What does justice mean to you?

129
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,241
Are you sure you made a fair judgment?

130
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:00,325
Yes.

131
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:04,163
No.

132
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,833
There's no point in asking you this.

133
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,752
Anyone would know it in their hearts.

134
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,801
To me, justice is

135
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,181
not something found
through questions and debates.

136
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:25,684
It's equity

137
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:27,728
and common sense

138
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,189
everyone knows in their hearts.

139
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:38,780
Equity and common sense
that everyone knows in their hearts?

140
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,370
It aligns with my definition in some ways.

141
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,875
No.

142
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,711
To you, justice is

143
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,630
self-righteousness.

144
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,313
Who's the lady you came with
the last time?

145
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:12,606
She was so pretty.

146
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,524
Pretty? Who was it?

147
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,485
I came with Ms. Yu from Haenal Law Firm.

148
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,115
Are you planning your wedding
now that you've given Mr. Eom

149
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,617
as your sacrifice to Haenal?

150
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:25,577
No, it's too soon.

151
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,079
Come on.

152
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:28,830
You mixed her jjajangmyeon

153
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,125
and tied her apron for her.
You have to marry her!

154
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,129
It's cowardly for a man not to marry her
after all that flirting!

155
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,589
I just...

156
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,467
You tied her apron for her?
You're basically married.

157
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,970
Right.

158
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,556
The lady was looking at you
with so much love.

159
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,560
Enjoy your dinner.

160
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:59,111
I didn't know you were a coward.

161
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:00,237
Me?

162
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,364
Bottoms-up.

163
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:05,117
Don't be a coward and leave any.

164
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:17,587
One more glass?

165
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:27,931
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

166
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,103
Did you check it?

167
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,815
We'll know soon enough.

168
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:39,276
It's 30 million won
from Sarang Securities, correct?

169
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,986
Tae-sik's illegal loans were exposed

170
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:42,988
with the arrest of the loan officer

171
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:46,116
at the Jeongdaun Savings Bank
for embezzlement.

172
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,828
It won't be easy to get an arrest warrant
for Tae-sik.

173
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,581
The higher-ups will do anything
to stop me.

174
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,291
30 million won...

175
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,585
Why do you need a warrant?
You know your expertise.

176
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:57,711
What?

177
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,004
An emergency arrest?

178
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,630
Break Tae-sik's back first.

179
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,174
I'll twist his neck.

180
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,844
So, I have to do all the work.

181
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:09,056
Don't you know Tae-sik's neck is guarded
by Sin-jin?

182
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,724
It'll be harder to twist his neck.

183
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,392
Okay, fine.

184
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,978
Be ready to twist his neck any moment.

185
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,188
Don't worry.

186
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:18,940
I'll be sure to warm up.

187
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,160
Mr. Han Gwang-hun, the loan officer
at Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

188
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:31,536
Yes.

189
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,791
You invested 150 million won
using embezzled money

190
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,251
until just last month.

191
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,545
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,923
I'll do everything to return the money.

193
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,592
No need. You didn't steal my money.

194
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:47,677
Sorry?

195
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,640
You were going to return the money
once the stock prices went up, anyway.

196
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,893
- Aren't I right?
- Sorry?

197
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,898
Oh, yeah, that's right.

198
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,986
What a convincing, honest confession.

199
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:07,239
It's like you're making a confessional.

200
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:11,743
That being said

201
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,330
help me serve our country.

202
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,416
Be a buddy.

203
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,797
TESTIMONY BY KIM SEOK-TAE

204
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:25,507
Jang Tae-sik.

205
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,136
I'll make sure you don't commit
any more crimes in this life.

206
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,679
We can't put

207
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,223
more people in misery because of you.

208
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,018
But don't you even dream
of going to heaven.

209
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,825
- Yes?
- Han-young, you bastard!

210
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:53,618
What bastard? Me?

211
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,328
Yeah, you.

212
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,456
How dare you scam me?

213
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,958
You're dead.

214
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,503
Prosecutor Park!

215
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,965
The day I...

216
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,052
Remember the day
I was robbed of my three billion won?

217
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,516
You were pretty damn busy
with Mr. Lee, huh?

218
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:18,977
CALL HISTORY

219
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,856
You're dead, too, alright?

220
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,321
Yes.

221
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,283
The call history from you made
the world of a difference.

222
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,661
Alright, looking forward to it.

223
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,337
Lee Seong-dae has

224
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,672
a record of everywhere we've been
and our call history

225
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,341
around the time of the Miracle scam.

226
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:52,469
What do we do now?
Sin-jin is going to catch on soon.

227
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,681
Don't worry.

228
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,558
Seong-dae and his greed will make him fall

229
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,185
into yet another trap.

230
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,573
So, how did that humble little party go
last time?

231
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,034
- Did you have a good time?
- Were you there?

232
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,869
No, well...

233
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:21,456
Yeah, I went there
and went right back home.

234
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,001
Isn't it about time
you introduce me to your friends?

235
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:26,920
I don't have any.

236
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,797
I didn't keep you hidden.

237
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,132
I just had nobody to introduce you to.

238
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,177
But you have friends,
you're just taking too long.

239
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,513
There we go!

240
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:38,181
I'm counting on you.

241
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:39,766
Not for free.

242
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,435
I get a wish, no questions asked.

243
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,895
If you don't want that, just go.

244
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,940
Okay, then.

245
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:48,358
Fine.

246
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:51,069
I'll do it. Just don't mess up.

247
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,950
Han-young, you bastard.

248
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,618
Have a seat.

249
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,123
I see why Haenal's daughter

250
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:05,875
came to that bullshit investment seminar.

251
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,296
I heard you guys were getting married.

252
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,214
What a match made in heaven, huh?

253
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,009
Aw, are you already congratulating us?

254
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,221
When did you clean up this office?

255
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,307
Are you dumb

256
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,058
or fearless?

257
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,521
The police will look everywhere

258
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,608
but not here again.

259
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,735
Cheol-woo.

260
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:32,986
We meet yet again.

261
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,240
This is 500 million won.

262
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,827
Just 500 million?

263
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,457
Give me my three billion won back
right now.

264
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:48,251
Or else, I take all of you down.

265
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,545
I'll give you three billion in a week.

266
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,465
That'll mean
that you have made 500 million.

267
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,216
That's a good investment.

268
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,094
You won't need to worry
about your daughter abroad now.

269
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,764
Shut up, you bastard.

270
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:04,559
You think I'll fall for it again?

271
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,646
Join our firm once things settle.

272
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,524
I know you're a Presiding Judge
at the Seoul Central Court.

273
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,777
I'll give you an office with a good view.

274
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:17,072
Not a bad offer
for keeping your mouth shut, huh?

275
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,658
Shut it.

276
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:21,785
You think I'll fall for it again?

277
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,329
Give me back my three billion right now!

278
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,580
Man.

279
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,333
I told you. We don't have it right now!

280
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,005
Better look for it, then.

281
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,135
Shall I call Sin-jin right now?

282
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,266
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

283
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,436
Wait.

284
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,188
I'll give it to you now.

285
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:55,527
You bastard. You don't even have the guts
to carry through it.

286
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:57,612
The account number is

287
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,031
236021069923

288
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,575
for Ms. Lee Seon-yeong
at Gukje Bank, right?

289
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,743
DEPOSIT AMOUNT: 0 WON

290
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,453
Damn you!

291
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,455
- Hold on.
- Wait a second.

292
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:08,748
- Who the hell are you?
- Stop.

293
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,625
How do you know
my daughter's bank account?

294
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,461
Don't you lay a finger on him!

295
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,671
She knows how to slap people!

296
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,881
Let go! Let go right now!

297
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:19,426
- You want to die?
- Let go!

298
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,553
We can die later.
Let's calm down first, okay?

299
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:23,471
Calm down, Se-hee.

300
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,391
That's not the issue here!

301
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:29,561
What do you think will happen
if I send three billion won to her?

302
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:32,564
Don't you want to know
how Sin-jin would react to that?

303
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,816
- Don't you?
- You bastard.

304
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,192
So, calm down.

305
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:39,904
I guess I can't give you three billion.
You don't want it.

306
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,072
You know what?

307
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,491
I guess this isn't your money, either.

308
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,993
But you know

309
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,954
if you want to join Haenal,
I'll still hire you.

310
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,957
You're not the only official
pulling this crap, anyway.

311
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,375
Nobody will care if we hire you.

312
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,752
You're kidding.

313
00:21:05,388 --> 00:21:07,849
Let me give you some advice, Seong-dae.

314
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:12,228
Shut up and leave.

315
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,646
Sorry?

316
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,026
Before the world hears
about all the bribes you've taken

317
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,865
to collude with criminals.

318
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,671
LEE SEONG-DAE'S BRIBE TRANSACTION RECORDS

319
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:47,931
LIST OF LEE SEONG-DAE'S ACCOUNTS
FOR RECEIVING BRIBES

320
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,320
Yes, sir.

321
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:05,156
I've checked

322
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:08,409
and I seem to have been mistaken.

323
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,542
Quit.

324
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,087
You'll never hear from Mr. Kang again.

325
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:29,097
How was this idiot mistaken?

326
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,796
It's my turn to make a wish.

327
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,964
No.

328
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:05,341
Why not? I did everything you asked!

329
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,926
That's ridiculous!

330
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:10,597
Vroom!

331
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,599
Time to make my wish!

332
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,350
"Vroom," my ass.

333
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:22,066
I can't believe you didn't take her out
for dinner until so late.

334
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,239
I hope you like it.

335
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,159
Thank you.

336
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,791
May I...

337
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:42,962
have some more?

338
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,089
Of course! Have more!

339
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,424
Honey, get some more rice.

340
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:48,509
I was worried you'd only have one bowl.

341
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,886
I'm so glad.

342
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,181
What are you doing?
The rice cooker is there.

343
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:55,642
Your dad is nervous.

344
00:23:59,812 --> 00:24:01,272
She seems nice, right?

345
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:03,066
You think he'll marry her?

346
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:04,901
Come on. Don't get ahead of yourself.

347
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:07,111
We've only had a meal together now.

348
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,696
Well, two servings of it, though.

349
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,700
But he wouldn't bring just any woman over
for dinner, would he?

350
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,202
They could've eaten out.

351
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:15,286
Right?

352
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,706
- Look at you.
- What?

353
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,124
- You're ridiculous.
- What?

354
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,417
My gosh.

355
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:24,295
The weather is so nice.

356
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,797
Man, I'm full.

357
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,928
Let's see if I can get a cab.

358
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,482
Mr. Lee

359
00:24:45,274 --> 00:24:48,319
you're not a bad man, are you?

360
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:53,116
"Good" and "bad" are all relative terms.

361
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,036
I know.

362
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,164
But what kind of a person

363
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,793
are you to me?

364
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,340
My husband took bribes

365
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,509
to play in favor of people in court.

366
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,886
He wanted to open an attorney office

367
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:16,514
for money laundering reasons, too.

368
00:25:17,223 --> 00:25:19,017
I tried to stop him

369
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,769
and he said he wanted a divorce.

370
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:32,155
Forget it.

371
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:33,656
No need to answer me.

372
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,658
I'll just think whatever I want.

373
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,951
It's not like I ever cared

374
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,412
about what others thought.

375
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,459
Oh!

376
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,731
Your mother is a wonderful cook.

377
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:09,233
See you.

378
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:27,794
Se-hee...

379
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:39,180
THESE ARE THE FILES

380
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:41,182
S SHOPPING SENT TO JEONGDAUN SAVINGS BANK

381
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:43,017
FOR ITS LOAN APPLICATIONS

382
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,229
Gosh.

383
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,025
SEND

384
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,902
THE MAIL HAS BEEN SENT SUCCESSFULLY

385
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,418
LOAN APPLICATIONS FROM S SHOPPING

386
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,628
Mr. Baek

387
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:12,880
I'll send you a record
of S Shopping's loans.

388
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,091
Let me know if anything looks suspicious.

389
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:17,093
We'll get moving as soon as you're done.

390
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,390
It's me.

391
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,725
I got the record of S Shopping's loans.

392
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,644
Get Tae-sik under an emergency arrest

393
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:29,147
and Ms. Song will spread the word
about his slush funds

394
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,607
being at the Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

395
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,942
If we spread the word

396
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:34,694
the higher-ups will try to stop us.

397
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:36,320
That's exactly what I want.

398
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,573
Keep him arrested
just until his father hears

399
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,907
about the slush funds.

400
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,576
You have something else on him?

401
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:45,496
Tae-sik isn't the only one
with slush funds

402
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,957
deposited at the Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

403
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,042
Yong-hyeon also has his funds
with the bank.

404
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,088
Really? Are you sure?

405
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,215
I can't tell her
I know this from my past life.

406
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,425
Oh...

407
00:27:58,926 --> 00:28:01,095
You know the previous cases

408
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:03,472
with S Group and S Shopping?

409
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,350
I just have a feeling
based on those cases.

410
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,311
A feeling.

411
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,897
A hunch?

412
00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:13,733
So, you're not even sure?

413
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,861
Ms. Kim,
I found a case of an illicit loan.

414
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:17,945
Should we go right now?

415
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,283
Yeah, let's go.

416
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,954
Tae-sik's investigation went

417
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,874
from illegal loans to slush funds
in my past life.

418
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:32,376
That led Tae-sik to step down
from S Shopping

419
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,503
and the slush funds went
to the National Treasury.

420
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,589
But the bigger issue here was

421
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:38,841
Jang Yong-hyeon, his father's slush funds.

422
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,432
The call cannot be completed.

423
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:49,393
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

424
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,776
Hey, Sin-jin.

425
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,194
It's me.

426
00:28:58,277 --> 00:29:01,239
Did you hear
about the Jeongdaun Savings Bank?

427
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:03,824
The prosecution may arrest him
in an emergency arrest

428
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,410
but we can stop things from getting worse.

429
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,247
Please take care of it.

430
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,962
Tae-sik, this moron!
Why this one, of all banks?

431
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,673
Why does it have to be
Jeongdaun Savings Bank?

432
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:21,717
He'll be in bigger trouble
if Jeongdaun Savings gets busted.

433
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:25,596
Don't tell me
he'll just call to sort it again.

434
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:36,691
You should've been on your toes.

435
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:42,238
Keep him arrested
just until his father hears

436
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:43,656
about the slush funds.

437
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,916
A hellish life is still better than hell.

438
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,794
Don't regret it all once you're dead.

439
00:29:56,877 --> 00:29:58,421
Don't take this too far.

440
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,882
All these paper stacks mean nothing.

441
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,760
You can't get me with them.

442
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,846
When something like this happens

443
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:08,472
the criminal gets away.

444
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,933
We have our boys
to serve time in jail, okay?

445
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,435
I know.

446
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,812
When rich bastards commit a crime

447
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:17,648
they say their employees did it
and that they had no idea.

448
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,358
They always find a way out.

449
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,943
I know it well.

450
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,239
That being said

451
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,367
I don't care who your boy is this time.

452
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,455
I'm just interested
in taking some of your money.

453
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,209
What the hell are you talking about?

454
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,880
For example

455
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,840
maybe some slush funds

456
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:44,759
that S Shopping has
with Jeongdaun Savings?

457
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,850
You're panicking, so it must be true.

458
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:57,021
Get on it now.

459
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:00,649
Hey.

460
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,027
Have you heard the news?

461
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,822
Jang Tae-sik, the CEO of S Shopping

462
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,658
has 50 billion won hidden
with Jeongdaun Savings.

463
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,329
This is a big deal if it's true, right?

464
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,706
Yeah, I just heard about it now.

465
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,416
Na-yeon, did you hear?

466
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,252
Jang Tae-sik, the CEO of S Shopping

467
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,129
has 50 billion won in slush funds!

468
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,381
Really?

469
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,132
Perfect.

470
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,967
TOP SEARCHED KEYWORDS
JANG TAE-SIK'S 50 BILLION WON

471
00:31:27,593 --> 00:31:29,929
Words about Yong-hyeon's slush funds
got out

472
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:31,972
because the investigation on Tae-sik

473
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,974
became the biggest news among people.

474
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,434
I apologize.

475
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:39,105
S Shopping received illicit loans

476
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,232
from Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

477
00:31:41,315 --> 00:31:42,400
Not only that

478
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,735
but I hid 50 billion won

479
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,364
under an alias at the same bank.

480
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,868
I am sorry.

481
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,875
In the past life, the judge gave Tae-sik
a suspended sentence

482
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,627
and the prosecution claimed

483
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,421
Yong-hyeon's slush funds were a rumor.

484
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,257
Yong-hyeon got away
by throwing his son under the bus.

Ms. Kim

00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:15,891
Tae-sik won't get away

488
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,436
with a suspended sentence this time.

489

Chairman Jang Yong-hyeon.

490
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,862
There's no way he thinks

491
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:30,448
he can save
both his son and his slush funds.

492
00:32:35,202 --> 00:32:36,662
Or maybe he does.

493
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,625

00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,852
Mr. Jang Tae-sik will return home

496
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:01,645
once the detention limit passes.

497
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,732
They won't get his arrest warrant.

498
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:09,236
You said you'd help,
so I'm sure it'll work out.

499
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,827
Your slush funds with Jeongdaun Savings.

500
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,371
Give that up.

501
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,792
Come on.

502
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,337
Tae-sik worked hard to save up that much.

503
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,714
I feel bad about letting all of it go.

504
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:30,674
If you think the 50 billion

505
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,676
that Tae-sik saved up is too precious

506
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:37,014
I can't imagine how you feel

507
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:39,183
about the 500 billion you've saved up.

508
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,267
What?

509
00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:45,564
Why do you look so surprised?

510
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:48,442
I thought that was what you were here for.

511
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,486
- Sin-jin.
- Right.

512
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,823
It's not easy to give up 500 billion won.

513
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,493
Sin-jin!

514
00:33:57,576 --> 00:34:00,871
Once the prosecution starts investigating
Tae-sik's slush funds

515
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,707
they'll find yours in no time

516
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,626
and Mr. President will find out.

517
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:12,049
S Group only grew so big
by colluding with politicians.

518
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,927
If you get on Mr. President's bad side

519
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,347
that strong tie will break,
and he'll make sure you feel the lash.

520
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,769
So what?

521
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:30,943
You need to sort it out quickly
before Mr. President finds out.

522
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:34,530
And you're willing to help me?

523
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,659
The best-case scenario for now is
to have Tae-sik admit to his allegations

524
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:41,370
and go to court.

525
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:44,373
What will the world think

526
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,250
if S Group's heir ends up in jail?

527
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,919
They'll think
I can't even keep my son tame.

528
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,296
It'll crush our reputation.

529
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,381
On grounds that he complies
with the prosecution

530
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:54,758
sincerely apologizes for what he's done

531
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,761
that he's made
a huge contribution to Korea's economy

532
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,555
and for many other reasons

533
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:01,390
he'll walk away with a suspended sentence.

534
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:04,935
And if he agrees to reimburse
for the damages done

535
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:08,230
I'm sure
S Group's reputation will improve.

536
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,190
You expect me to pay
for that reimbursement?

537
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:12,818
Can I trust you that much
to keep your word?

538
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,369
Are you sure about the suspended sentence?

539
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,789
It won't be an issue

540
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,125
as long as Attorney Byeon helps Tae-sik
with the load.

541
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,336
Can he do that?

542
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:33,797
A servant has to follow his master.

543
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,844
I'll never forget

544
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,765
your help.

545
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:45,309
Feel free to forget.

546
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:46,769
But

547
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:50,564
I'll need 100 billion won in return.

548
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,652
100 billion won?

549
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,863
It's not about losing 100 billion.

550
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,115
Think about the 400 billion won

551
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,534
and Mr. President's trust
that you'll get to keep.

552
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,788
That's the only way

553
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:07,915
to save you and S Group.

554
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:11,710
Are you blackmailing me?

555
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,798
I'd say this is a win-win situation.

556
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,347
Since we need to convince the public

557
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,017
the prosecution will indict him
while in custody

558
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:32,189
and Judge Lee, whom we met at the Suojae,
will be on the case.

559
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:51,667
There will come a day
when you'll be in my place.

560
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,918
When that happens...

561
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,005
be sure

562
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,466
to remember this moment.

563
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:32,291
Welcome back.

564
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,252
It was tough.

565
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,714
The prosecutor was a real bitch.

566
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,301
I'm sure you're tired. Get some rest.

567
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:47,222
Dad.

568
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,935
Sorry about the slush funds.

569
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,400
Leave everything behind and start new.

570
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:01,278
What do you mean?

571
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:03,197
Leave what?

572
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:06,867
The prosecution will indict you

573
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:09,495
under detention.

574
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,207
What?

575
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,417
They let me out, so why again?

576
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,544
Indictment or not

577
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,047
why can't I just go to court
without detention?

578
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,965
Think about the public, too.

579
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,597
What?

580
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,557
Dad...

581
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:33,811
Dad!

582
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,771
Father!

583
00:38:37,856 --> 00:38:38,899
Father!

584
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:41,318
You want me to crawl into a little cell

585
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:43,111
where all the lowly people go?

586
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,571
Damn it!

587
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,700
Come on!

588
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:51,912
It's that prosecutor bitch, isn't it?

589
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,790
She started this
with the tax evasion case!

590
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:58,001
She thinks I'm a moron!

591
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,507
I'll break her limbs

592
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:07,052
with her father's
and bury them upside-down!

593
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,235
KIM SEOK-TAE

594
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,539
Come on.

595
00:39:35,914 --> 00:39:37,875
This time, let's break your legs first

596
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,251
before your head.

597
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:42,212
There's no better way
to silence the evictees

598
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,881
than taking them to court with this.

599
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,466
No, this won't do. Pass me that one.

600
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,094
- Sir...
- Hold him.

601
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:51,013
- You already hit me last week!
- Stop moving.

602
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:52,973
You already hit me last week!

603
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:54,600
- We have to go again if you move.
- Sir!

604
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,059
Let's just do it in one-go.

605
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,146
I told you not to move!

606
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:00,230
Alright.

607
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,150
Is it broken?

608
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:15,579
I knew you looked familiar.

609
00:40:15,662 --> 00:40:20,292
How many times did I break his limbs
and hit his head?

610
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:27,633
I wondered
why that bitch kept coming at me

611
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,343
as if her life depended on it.

612
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:31,511
How inspiring.

613
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,263
So damn inspiring.

614
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:43,982
Hey, Byeon.

615
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,277
Dad probably has some slush funds
at Jeongdaun, right?

616
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:50,530
Yes, I think so.

617
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:52,741
He wants to sacrifice me

618
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:54,910
because he doesn't want anyone
to mess with that.

619
00:40:55,994 --> 00:40:59,873
I can't let anyone take that money.

620
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,377
That'll all be mine one day.

621
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,798
Fine. I'll take one for the team.

622
00:41:12,844 --> 00:41:14,012
Hey, Dad.

623
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,682
Delay that arrest warrant by a week.

624
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,975
What for?

625
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,811
I have some urgent stuff to take care of
before I go.

626
00:41:20,894 --> 00:41:22,187
Don't worry.

627
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:24,523
Whatever it is, you only have one week.

628
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,941
Alright.

629
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,699
- Hey, Byeon.
- Yes?

630
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,075
Find someone.

631
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:38,620
What for?

632
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:43,542
Someone to send
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a far, far away.

633
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:49,131
We've been ordered to indict Tae-sik
under detention.

634
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:50,799
He's begun to cut his ties now.

635
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,384
But in this life

636
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:54,219
we have to get Yong-hyeon's funds, too.

637
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:58,223
That's the only way
to strike Sin-jin and Gwang-to, too.

638
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:02,269
It's because of Yong-hyeon's slush funds

639
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:04,771
at Jeongdaun Savings.

640
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,607
I guess you were right.

641
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,318
They wouldn't have allowed me
to indict him otherwise.

642
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,528
And as it turns out

643
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,156
the Deputy Prosecutor General ordered it.

644
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,615
After Mr. Eom joined Haenal

645
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,036
the prosecution has been
without a Prosecutor General.

646
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,830
That leaves the Deputy Prosecutor General
to take over.

647
00:42:21,913 --> 00:42:23,582
Yong-hyeon would've requested it

648
00:42:23,665 --> 00:42:26,752
and Sin-jin would've told
the Deputy Prosecutor General to do it.

649
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,171
He's sacrificing Tae-sik

650
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:32,382
to stop further investigations.

651
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,302
I guess money matters more than his kid.

652
00:42:36,511 --> 00:42:38,680
But Tae-sik has 50 billion won
in slush funds.

653
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:42,309
How much does his father have
if they can throw that away?

654
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:43,852
Probably a few hundred billion won.

655
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,521
500 billion won, to be exact.

656
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:49,608
Including the funds at other banks

657
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:52,277
paper companies, and international banks,
probably in the trillions.

658
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,074
That means we're giving them
what they want

659
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,784
by ending it at Tae-sik's arrest.

660
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:00,452
We can grab Tae-sik

661
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,621
and shake up the whole S Group.

662
00:43:03,955 --> 00:43:05,707
Tae-sik may be the start

663
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,085
but we can get to Yong-hyeon and Sin-jin

664
00:43:08,418 --> 00:43:10,587
and send them all to jail.

665
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,755
Let's do that.

666
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:13,590
We might as well arrest them all.

667
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,718
There's something I haven't told you guys.

668
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,430
There's another garbage
we have to take out.

669
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,184
I followed Nam-yong one day

670
00:43:24,267 --> 00:43:25,560
and that was the day

671
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,896
I found

672
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:30,357
the worst trash of them all.

673
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,901
Who's that?

674
00:43:34,027 --> 00:43:36,071
The real big hand that moves Korea.

675
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:38,990
The leader of the shadow government

676
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:42,035
Park Gwang-to, the former President.

677
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,375
You're all here!
Why are you standing outside?

678
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,752
- You have to open it.
- Oh, right. It's my office.

679
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:53,255
Park Gwang-to?

680
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:54,548
Damn...

681
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,469
You know, I voted for that guy.

682
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,304
This is ridiculous. I feel so betrayed!

683
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,389
Here, Han-young.

684
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,185
- I'll take two.
- Okay.

685
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,523
Hold on.

686
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,609
Are you two the only ones here?

687
00:44:18,196 --> 00:44:20,615
You know I have to exhaust my knees
because of him, right?

688
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:24,369
My wrists hurt with all the paperwork.
Being a judge is hard.

689
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,875
Reporters have to deal with just as much.

690
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,251
You should have some, then.

691
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:32,335
Come here.

692
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:34,546
Open that. I'll give this to Ms. Song.

693
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,214
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.

694
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,092
You think our joints are made of steel
because we're prosecutors?

695
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,139
Cheol-woo,
you can be so inconsiderate sometimes.

696
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:45,974
I was getting some for you.

697
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:54,941
By the way

698
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,402
you all know the To's Club, right?

699
00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:00,655
The club for people who love Gwang-to.

700
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,743
They'll try to kill us
if they know what we're doing.

701
00:45:05,785 --> 00:45:08,455
Yeah, he's not an easy one to take on.

702
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,915
Feel free to forget

703
00:45:10,373 --> 00:45:11,958
everything I just said.

704
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,710
How can I?

705
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:15,921
- It's so interesting.
- Why?

706
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:19,507
You think I'll get scared and run away
because it's the former President?

707
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,092
Is that why you didn't tell us?

708
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,761
Who do you think I am?

709
00:45:22,844 --> 00:45:23,970
Hey.

710
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,473
How can we forget what you just said?
We're not goldfish.

711
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:27,682
Suojae is

712
00:45:28,266 --> 00:45:30,769
the real powerhouse that moves Korea.

713
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,438
Everyone there is terrible.
Terribly powerful.

714
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,774
So, stay out of it.

715
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:37,943
You, too, Ms. Song.

716
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,110
- What do you mean?
- What?

717
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,278
My gosh!

718
00:45:41,112 --> 00:45:42,280
I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

719
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,699
I'm the one who discovered Suojae.

720
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,117
There's no way I'm stopping!

721
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,869
How can I do that?

722
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,955
And you're not even asking me
to stay out of it.

723
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,458
You said we were a team.

724
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,628
One team.

725
00:46:05,136 --> 00:46:06,263
Oh, gosh.

726
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:09,391
What are you two doing?

727
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:14,020
It was an accident.

728
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:21,194
You're trying to get Tae-sik

729
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:24,906
because of your father, right?

730
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:32,872
You ran a background check on me?

731
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,083
No.

732
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,377
I just happened to find out.

733
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,646
TESTIMONY

734
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,231
CONFIDENTIAL

735
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,734
TESTIMONY BY KIM SEOK-TAE

736
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:12,871
I beat up the protesting evictees

737
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,998
and cussed at them.

738
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,750
Because Mr. Jang Tae-sik

739
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:21,087
of S Construction told me to.

740
00:47:21,546 --> 00:47:23,173
Mr. Jang

741
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,177
banged my head against the wall

742
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,096
and broke my arms

743
00:47:30,555 --> 00:47:32,474
using a baseball bat.

744
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:36,686
I lied to the judge

745
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,857
saying the protesters hit me

746
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,068
and left me with a head injury
and a broken arm.

747
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:44,903
The judge concluded

748
00:47:45,403 --> 00:47:49,616
that the protester beat me up.

749
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,577
Mr. Jang paid me

750
00:47:52,994 --> 00:47:56,498
a million won
and paid for my hospital bills.

751
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,750
Mr. Jang told me

752
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:03,546
he'd give me another chance to make money

753
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,384
and told me to come again
once my bones were healed.

754
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:14,015
Dad was a bad man.

755
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,813
But he loved his daughter

756
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,149
to his bones, literally.

757
00:48:23,983 --> 00:48:26,861
Jin-a, have some meat.

758
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,613
It's so good.

759
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,826
Whenever Dad came home, injured

760
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,203
- we ate out.
- Do you have money for this?

761
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,414
Of course, I do.

762
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,498
You want to see it?

763
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,751
Ta-da.

764
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:43,837
Jin-a, here.

765
00:48:45,004 --> 00:48:46,923
This is your allowance.

766
00:48:47,006 --> 00:48:48,883
You don't have money, right? Here.

767
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:52,554
On those days,
I'd get my overdue tutor fees

768
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:54,764
and pocket money.

769
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,946
You know, I dream of the day

770
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,283
you put on a white blouse every morning

771
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:17,370
to go to a real job.

772
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,748
I hope you'll get to work late nights

773
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,126
and go drinking with your colleagues, too.

774
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,920
I hope you'll get to live

775
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:30,133
like everyone else.

776
00:49:31,676 --> 00:49:33,011
Gosh, what am I even saying?

777
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:34,888
Let's go.

778
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,192
He lived in hell

779
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,362
but I guess he wanted me to live
like everyone else.

780
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,328
But he had no idea

781
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,249
I also wanted a dad

782
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,045
who would put on a white-collared shirt

783
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,007
and go to work in the morning
and come home in the evening.

784
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,302
He didn't know I wanted a normal dad, too.

785
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,768
I studied like my life depended on it.

786
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,272
To get far away from my embarrassing dad.

787
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:34,906
But before I could even run away

788
00:50:35,573 --> 00:50:37,367
he fainted.

789
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,997
He was doing everything Tae-sik wanted

790
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:46,042
and his body gave in.

791
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,799
I only realized when my dad fainted

792
00:50:55,843 --> 00:50:59,430
that it wasn't him
from whom I wanted to run from.

793
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,852
Instead, it was my guilt
of having been raised

794
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,857
through his broken bones and head.

795
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,755
Where did you get this, anyway?

796
00:51:42,348 --> 00:51:45,935
The evictee your father framed was

797
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:50,356
my father.

798
00:51:59,073 --> 00:52:00,116
What?

799
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:01,993
You knew about it?

800
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,207
When we went to the junkyard.

801
00:52:17,675 --> 00:52:18,676
Hello?

802
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,927
Do you need help?

803
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:33,566
I went there to apologize
on behalf of my dad.

804
00:52:45,578 --> 00:52:46,621
I see.

805
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,760
The lead judge of the case was

806
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:03,429
Justice Hwang Nam-yong,
who recently resigned

807
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,765
and Sin-jin was the associate judge.

808
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,225
What?

809
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:11,020
That was why I made Nam-yong resign.

810
00:53:18,986 --> 00:53:21,239
Tae-sik made a fortune
through redevelopments

811
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:23,533
but hurt many people in the process.

812
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:26,744
My father and yours

813
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,413
as well as all the evictees

814
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:33,042
who lost their homes
due to the redevelopments are all victims.

815
00:53:43,594 --> 00:53:46,305
Where your donation leads to happiness.

816
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,058
Seonjin Happiness Foundation is with you.

817
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,102
What a good man he is.

818
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:52,186
- Right?
- Right?

819
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,438
We should donate, too.

820
00:53:56,023 --> 00:53:57,108
Cut! Okay.

821
00:53:57,191 --> 00:53:58,484
- All good?
- Yes.

822
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:00,778
That was a bit awkward, wasn't it?

823
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:07,034
What a handsome old man.

824
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,917
Oh, my. He donated all his wealth?

825
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,839
There are so many amazing people
in the world.

826
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:22,133
My gosh.

827
00:54:22,216 --> 00:54:24,260
Please use the money to help
the students in need.

828
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:27,472
Yes, we'll put the money to good use.

829
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,681
- Thank you.
- Yes.

830
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,057
Give him a round of applause.

831
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,977
- Here.
- Let's take a photo.

832
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,979
- Okay.
- Smile!

833
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,649
One, two, three, cheese!

834
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,027
SEONJIN HAPPINESS FOUNDATION

835
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,696
CHAIRMAN KANG SUN-CHEOL

836
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,952
Yes, Mr. President.

837
00:54:51,704 --> 00:54:52,955
That's right.

838
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,875
The story of the old man donating
all his money from collecting scraps

839
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:59,212
seems to have touched people
really deep in their hearts.

840
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,714
As soon as the story got out

841
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,299
we got an influx of new donors.

842
00:55:03,382 --> 00:55:06,177
Some idiots even made huge donations...

843
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,847
Oh, no. I mean, some people even made
huge donations.

844
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,934
Yes, I'll always be careful.

845
00:55:13,017 --> 00:55:15,269
Yes, Mr. President.

846
00:55:17,438 --> 00:55:19,732
Mr. Kang, I've booked a room
at the hostess bar.

847
00:55:23,402 --> 00:55:24,946
What? Why?

848
00:55:26,405 --> 00:55:27,949
In broad daylight?

849
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:30,117
A hostess bar? Seriously?

850
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,494
- Get on the floor.
- Yes, sir.

851
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:32,995
You moron.

852
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,039
- Wake up.
- Wake up!

853
00:55:35,456 --> 00:55:36,999
- Be on your toes.
- Be on your toes!

854
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,167
Get up.

855
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,586
- Turn around.
- Turning around!

856
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,255
- At a 45-degree angle.
- At 45 degrees.

857
00:55:43,881 --> 00:55:46,175
Let's go!

858
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:47,885
- Let's go!
- Go!

859
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,929
- Let's go!
- Go!

860
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:51,055
Come on!

861
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:55,059
Press 2 to confirm
that you're Ms. Park Mal-rye.

862
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,396
Confirmed.

863
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,816
It's done now.

864
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:05,194
Now, they'll withdraw 10,000 won
from your bank account

865
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,696
on the 25th day of each month.

866
00:56:06,779 --> 00:56:08,823
Oh, wow! Perfect.

867
00:56:08,906 --> 00:56:11,284
It's so thoughtful of you to do this.

868
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,869
I know you have it hard already.

869
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,289
No, some even donate everything they have.

870
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,748
This is nothing compared to them.

871
00:56:18,457 --> 00:56:20,209
Whenever I think about my Na-yeong

872
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:24,463
I feel like I need to do more good things
for good karma.

873
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:30,553
I know I shouldn't donate anything
with this mindset.

874
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,305
Why not?

875
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,931
It's for your granddaughter

876
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:37,143
and other children in the country.

877
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:38,436
Right?

878
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:40,897
Honey

879
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,024
it's all sorted now. Let's go home.

880
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:44,358
- Okay.
- And here.

881
00:56:45,192 --> 00:56:48,487
They were selling huge sacks of chestnuts
at the market.

882
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,614
It's chestnut season.

883
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,824
My gosh, you always have something for me.

884
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,784
I don't know how to thank you.

885
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,287
It's not that much. No need to thank us.

886
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:59,040
Thank you so much.

887
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,754
Don't you have a date? It's the weekend.

888
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,969
I'm meeting Jeong-ho later.

889
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:15,806
Why are you meeting a guy?
You have a girlfriend.

890
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,435
Did she break up with you already?

891
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,021
We fed her two bowls of rice that day.

892
00:57:22,104 --> 00:57:24,607
If she broke up with you after that,
that's stealing!

893
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:25,733
Han-young.

894
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:28,194
- Han-young!
- What?

895
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:29,403
No, right?

896
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:31,864
I'll see her again.

897
00:57:33,115 --> 00:57:34,533
See?

898
00:57:37,161 --> 00:57:39,413
Han-young

899
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,792
you know that thing?

900
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:44,293
Not even the Chief Justice

901
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,629
let alone a judge, can understand
what "that thing" is.

902
00:57:46,712 --> 00:57:48,047
Stop it!

903
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:50,716
You know the organization

904
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:53,219
former President Park advertises?

905
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:57,181
The one that helps kids in need
and sick kids.

906
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:01,018
The Seonjin Happiness Foundation?

907
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,853
Yeah, that one.

908
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,815
You know Ms. Park, who brings us scraps?

909
00:58:05,898 --> 00:58:09,735
She's donating 10,000 won per month now

910
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,279
so her granddaughter has good karma.

911
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:15,074
That's more than a whole cart
full of scraps.

912
00:58:15,157 --> 00:58:16,951
That's huge for her.

913
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:18,869
That being said

914
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,955
I also want to do something good

915
00:58:21,038 --> 00:58:23,374
for your good karma

916
00:58:23,457 --> 00:58:25,167
and make some donations.

917
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:26,794
They're good people, right?

918
00:58:26,877 --> 00:58:28,796
How can you doubt the foundation?

919
00:58:29,338 --> 00:58:32,216
You think Mr. Park would agree
to advertise a corrupt foundation?

920
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:38,180
I donate to a different organization

921
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:41,434
so don't ever donate to that one, okay?

922
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,605
Okay.

923
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:47,898
Okay.

924
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,865
This is a search and seizure.
Please comply.

925
00:58:55,948 --> 00:58:57,324
The Chairman of Seonjin was arrested

926
00:58:57,408 --> 00:59:00,536
for misappropriation of money
and breach of trust in the past life.

927
00:59:00,953 --> 00:59:03,330
There were rumors
that Gwang-to was behind this

928
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,249
but people eventually forgot about it.

929
00:59:07,376 --> 00:59:08,627
What are you doing?

930
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,337
Let go! Where are you taking me?

931
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,464
Fine!

932
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:12,965
Cover the table with newspapers.

933
00:59:15,801 --> 00:59:17,136
What's all this?

934
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:20,639
That's so much.

935
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,186
People at the market brought them.

936
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:28,105
Mr. Seok exchanges the food at the store
with them.

937
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,608
We get so much food

938
00:59:30,691 --> 00:59:33,652
that my grandma and I are getting chubby.

939
00:59:34,111 --> 00:59:36,072
Ms. Park looks even prettier
with some chub.

940
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,616
Stop the chitchat
and go back to your homework.

941
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:39,992
I'm already done.

942
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,119
Don't talk back! Do your homework!

943
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,370
Enjoy.

944
00:59:45,706 --> 00:59:47,666
Hey...

945
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,837
I didn't know you had this side of you.

946
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,382
Don't be too kind to your part-timers.

947
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,218
Look at her, talking back to her boss.

948
00:59:57,301 --> 00:59:58,928
It's like she has no manners.

949
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,475
- That's not it.
- Huh?

950
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,855
- Han-young...
- She's thankful.

951
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,359
She was smiling,
but the way she talked back...

952
01:00:13,984 --> 01:00:15,736
- You saw her.
- Alright, let's eat.

953
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,239
Mr. Park, you may be slow,
but you can still eat, too.

954
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,783
There's a high chance

955
01:00:20,866 --> 01:00:24,203
that the Seonjin Happiness Foundation is
Gwang-to's pool for his slush funds.

956
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,789
Let's give Tae-sik's case more publicity

957
01:00:26,872 --> 01:00:28,290
and strike Gwang-to, too.

958
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:31,627
That won't be easy.

959
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,880
He's so popular
that he could still get elected

960
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,590
if he were to run for presidency now.

961
01:00:37,174 --> 01:00:40,094
If we don't strike him properly,
he'll get all of us.

962
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,222
And his supporters won't stay still.

963
01:00:44,431 --> 01:00:45,683
That's why we have to expose

964
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:47,810
Gwang-to's ugly real self.

965
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:50,271
Here's a question.

966
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:53,440
How will Sin-jin react to us
attacking the Seonjin Happiness Foundation

967
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,276
and getting Gwang-to?

968
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,364
You said they were a team.

969
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:03,909
He'd try to use the Judiciary
to protect Gwang-to.

970
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:08,539
But if we shake things hard enough
for Gwang-to to fall from his treehouse

971
01:01:08,622 --> 01:01:11,292
Sin-jin will be tempted to do otherwise.

972
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:18,215
Because he wants to become
the leader of Suojae.

973
01:01:20,467 --> 01:01:23,679
This threat for Gwang-to will fuel a fire
for betrayal.

974
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:33,147
Oh.

975
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,982
About Tae-sik.

976
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,319
His arrest warrant has been delayed
by a week.

977
01:01:38,652 --> 01:01:39,653
Why?

978
01:01:40,112 --> 01:01:41,530
The higher-ups wouldn't tell us.

979
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,949
We have to wait a week, no matter what.

980
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,744
In the past life

981
01:01:46,827 --> 01:01:49,914
Tae-sik poisoned a CEO of an affiliate
to stage a suicide

982
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:52,875
and tried to stage my suicide, too.

983
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,085
Something is definitely up.

984
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:59,256
Was there anything odd
during his emergency arrest?

985
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:04,011
He denied all allegations
and talked like a snake, as always.

986
01:02:04,428 --> 01:02:05,638
Think carefully.

987
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:12,102
He talked about living and being in hell.

988
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:14,897
But that's all crap.

989
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:18,943
Wait.

990
01:02:38,545 --> 01:02:39,630
What was that?

991
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,844
FIND HAPPINESS
WITH SEONJIN HAPPINESS FOUNDATION

992
01:02:57,731 --> 01:03:00,150
I can't stop thinking about it.
I can't sleep.

993
01:03:47,531 --> 01:03:49,867
You definitely slept well last night.

994
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,327
Look at that glow!

995
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,873
No need to come here anymore.

996
01:03:55,956 --> 01:03:58,334
I'll weld my door shut
or sleep outside if I have to.

997
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,419
I'll take care of myself
until we get Tae-sik.

998
01:04:02,212 --> 01:04:03,339
See you at work.

999
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,091
Hey, Jin-a!

1000
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,470
Hey, here.

1001
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:15,017
Don't just tase anyone who annoys you.

1002
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,518
Don't shoot at anyone, okay?

1003
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,022
Who do you think I am?

1004
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,398
I don't need it.

1005
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,192
What? Don't make me sleep here again.

1006
01:04:31,408 --> 01:04:32,618
Thanks, anyway.

1007
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:34,411
See you at work.

1008
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,407
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

1009
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:18,163
No.

1010
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:25,170
THE JUDGE RETURNS

1011
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,919
Sin-jin wants to be the new leader there.

1012
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,088
I was going to get rid of them all

1013
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,756
once I became the leader of Suojae.

1014
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,592
To break it, I must trigger
a fracture from the inside.

1015
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,927
The target is
Park Gwang-to, the former President.

1016
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:16,472
Your ammo is corruption
in the Seonjin Happiness Foundation.

1017
01:06:16,638 --> 01:06:19,558
We found fraudulent ledgers!
How can we not investigate it?

1018
01:06:19,641 --> 01:06:22,227
You want to strike the Seonjin Foundation?
I can help you.

1019
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,353
What the hell are you doing?

1020
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,481
Someone said I was garbage.

1021
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:28,192
That crazy bastard!

1022
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,360
Didn't expect my chance to come so soon.

1023
01:06:30,652 --> 01:06:31,862
Do whatever you want.

1024
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:32,988
Bang!

1025
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:37,951
