1
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:34,950
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:39,788
SHIN NAM-SUK

3
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:05,606
But if you still insist that you were fair

4
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:08,609
look at me straight in the eyes
and tell me.

5
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:09,693
"Mother"

6
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:12,362
"I made a fair judgment."

7
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:14,031
"I'm a judge of justice."

8
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:17,326
Then, I'll believe you,
no matter what, okay?

9
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:54,029
I was very fair in court.

10
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:57,366
I'm a judge of justice.

11
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,701
I know it's too late

12
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:01,620
but...

13
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:07,793
But...

14
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,886
you'll be on my side, right, Mom?

15
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:42,995
SUPREME COURT

16
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:45,956
EPISODE 2

17
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,082
Where's Chairman Jang?

18
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,585
He should be with his attorney right now.

19
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,129
- Is that so?
- Yes.

20
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,511
How is it?

21
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:02,431
How's the food there?

22
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:11,565
I'll just think of this
as a little holiday

23
00:03:12,357 --> 00:03:16,153
but won't the Haenal Partner's daughter
be disappointed?

24
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,043
Seriously.

25
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,048
Why would you act so out of character?

26
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,468
How pesky.

27
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,262
ATTORNEY LEE HAN-YOUNG'S OFFICE

28
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:59,905
ATTORNEY LEE HAN-YOUNG

29
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:07,829
I didn't order that.

30
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:09,665
It's on the house.

31
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:12,960
Thank you.

32
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,506
How much will that be?

33
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:19,925
I'll transfer the money.

34
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,468
So, it's you.

35
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:24,805
You haven't told me the price yet.

36
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:27,683
It's you, Attorney Lee Han-young.

37
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:51,623
Who the hell are you?

38
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:15,480
ATTORNEY LEE HAN-YOUNG

39
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,468
Oh, no...

40
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:37,062
Excuse me.

41
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,399
Hello?

42
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:43,735
Excuse me?

43
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:37,539
ATTORNEY LEE HAN-YOUNG

44
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,040
Any information about him?

45
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,376
Hold on.

46
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,711
I found his wallet.

47
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,466
Kim Yong-jin, born in 1989.

48
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:51,470
You can come out now

49
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:52,888
Mr. Kim.

50
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:01,354
You know the flash drive I gave you?

51
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:03,815
I got it from him.

52
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,319
Leave the site immediately.

53
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,990
They must've left your fingerprints
all over the weapon of murder.

54
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,911
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

55
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:21,166
This must be Jang Tae-sik
getting his revenge.

56
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,919
I'm heading over. Let's meet.

57
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:26,963
There's no way you can handle it alone.

58
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,133
Are you listening?

59
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:31,885
Judge Lee.

60
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,387
I'll prove

61
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,306
my own innocence.

62
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:38,808
I'll call you later.

63
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,268
Hello?

64
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:41,895
Hello?

65
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:43,813
Damn it.

66
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:05,377
ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION

67
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,112
Okay, I can do this.

68
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,952
Oh, gosh.

69
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,045
Over there!

70
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,964
That's him.

71
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:52,048
This way!

72
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:56,636
Hey.

73
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,971
Hey!

74
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,234
Get him!

75
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:13,236
Over there! That's him!

76
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,325
No, it's not me.

77
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:20,660
- Stay still!
- It's not me.

78
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:22,912
I didn't do it.

79
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:29,628
It's not me.

80
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:33,840
I didn't do it.

81
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:36,718
I'm innocent.

82
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:46,853
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

83
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:52,692
Mr. Lee Han-young.

84
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:57,113
You're no longer a judge

85
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:59,199
nor an industry senior to me.

86
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:00,867
So

87
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,453
before those pants slip off

88
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,705
just be nice and work with me here.

89
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:14,964
EVIDENCE

90
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,549
We found your fingerprints on this

91
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:20,470
and a trace of the victim's blood.

92
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:23,890
Do you admit to your murder charge?

93
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,562
I've been framed.

94
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,233
How does it seem to you, as a judge?

95
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,362
If I brought these to the court

96
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,074
would Defendant Lee Han-young be
guilty or not?

97
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,252
I didn't kill him.

98
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,095
VICTIM

99
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,854
I'm not the murderer!

100
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:12,439
Stop him!

101
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:17,444
I've never even met the victim!

102
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,362
All evidence has been doctored.

103
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,614
Are you saying you didn't know him at all?

104
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,116
Exactly! I don't know him at all.

105
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,452
How can you explain
all the evidence found, then?

106
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:28,037
A corrupt judge who's been involved

107
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,039
in blackmailing, extortion,
and taking bribes for cases

108
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,625
killed an accomplice to destroy evidence

109
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,545
in this horrifying, unprecedented case.

110
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:38,423
According to the police

111
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,925
this judge has been taking bribes
of hundreds of millions of won

112
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:42,802
from politicians and corporate leaders

113
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,971
to rule in their favor in court for years.

114
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:48,308
And when investigations began
on his accomplice

115
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:49,392
he made a plan

116
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:52,562
to murder him.

117
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,398
Several traces of his attempt
to destroy any evidence were found

118
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,400
at the site of the murder.

119
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:59,736
The man was respected in society.

120
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:01,571
Still, underneath his judge's robe

121
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:04,991
he was just a criminal
who abused his authority for his benefit.

122
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:06,493
DEFENDANT

123
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,830
Defendant Lee Han-young

124
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:13,875
murdered his accomplice

125
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,752
and blackmailed him.

126
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,171
Hence, the prosecution files charges

127
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,215
against Mr. Lee Han-young.

128
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:24,761
Defendant, do you admit to the charges?

129
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:39,692
No.

130
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:40,777
No!

131
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,363
Defendant!

132
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,323
I didn't do it!

133
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:52,539
I didn't do it.

134
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:54,958
I'm...

135
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,460
I'm innocent.

136
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:01,214
I'm innocent!

137
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,551
I'm innocent.

138
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:06,886
I'm innocent.

139
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,264
I didn't do it.

140
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,099
I'm innocent.

141
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:21,818
Witness, are you the wife
of Accounting Manager Kim Yong-jin

142
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:25,530
the S Construction employee murdered
by Judge Lee Han-young?

143
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,240
Yes.

144
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:30,910
Has your husband told you anything

145
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:32,745
about Mr. Lee Han-young?

146
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:35,498
Yes.

147
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:42,589
Could you tell me

148
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:44,007
what he said?

149
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,594
JUDGE

150
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:52,098
My husband said

151
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:54,851
Judge Lee was
S Construction's legal counsel

152
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,355
who took bribes
to rule in favor of people in court.

153
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:07,697
Then, my husband got his hands

154
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,034
on the company's funds with Mr. Lee

155
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:14,704
and said that he feared
being caught in an internal audit.

156
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:16,372
So

157
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,002
he went out to see Judge Lee...

158
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:25,131
I had no idea when I was sitting up there.

159
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:28,343
I had no idea

160
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,139
why everyone sitting here

161
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,516
so desperately said it was unfair.

162
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,811
This is so unfair.

163
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,318
So unfair.

164
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:47,654
My husband took bribes

165
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:52,200
to play in favor of people in court.

166
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,996
He wanted to open an attorney's office

167
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:59,248
for money laundering reasons, too.

168
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,336
I tried to stop him

169
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,173
and he said he wanted a divorce.

170
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:10,843
Article 152, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act.

171
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:14,597
"A witness who,
having sworn according to Acts"

172
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:16,599
"gives false statement, shall be punished"

173
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:20,186
"by imprisonment for less than five years
or by a fine under ten million won."

174
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,271
- Defendant.
- Paragraph Two.

175
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:25,858
"As regards a criminal
or disciplinary case"

176
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:29,445
"a witness who, for the purpose
of causing injury to an accused"

177
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:31,406
"commits the crime
of the preceding paragraph"

178
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:36,202
"shall be punished by imprisonment
for less than ten years."

179
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:38,663
Defendant, what do you think you're doing?

180
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,208
I'm just stating the violations

181
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:44,919
Ms. Yu Se-hee is making

182
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:48,047
right now.

183
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:57,223
What is he talking about?

184
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,228
You're kidding me.

185
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:09,444
What happened to you?

186
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,035
You know your father was kicked out

187
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,203
of his care home, right?

188
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:22,749
You didn't know?

189
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:26,252
Here.

190
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:35,011
What did they do with my dad?

191
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:37,263
There's one more.

192
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:41,100
Have you no conscience?

193
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:43,853
You should've seen it coming.
You betrayed them first.

194
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:48,775
What the hell did you do with my dad?

195
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,277
You're such a terrible son.

196
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:55,448
Seriously.

197
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:57,658
But the worst thing would be

198
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:59,535
for you to die before your father.

199
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:01,287
What did you do with my dad...

200
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:05,875
What do you mean?

201
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:11,881
Some guys will be waiting for you

202
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:14,300
at the detention center.

203
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:17,553
Don't let them torture you.

204
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,055
Take this as soon as you get there.

205
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,557
Whatever kills you,
it'll be recorded as an accident.

206
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:28,231
Is this how you killed Choi Jong-hak, too?

207
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:32,985
I guess this isn't so bad for you yet.

208
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:34,821
You still have time to care about others?

209
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:36,572
Is Chairman Jang behind it?

210
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:39,492
You're so curious.
Of course, you're a judge.

211
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:41,452
But you weren't like this in trials.

212
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,330
Think about it carefully.

213
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,165
Starting from your wife

214
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:48,835
it's odd that you have
absolutely nobody, isn't it?

215
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:53,256
Chairman Jang wasn't the only one
in on this.

216
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:56,843
From the arrest
to the prosecution and the trial

217
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:00,179
don't you think things have progressed
too quickly?

218
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,684
Chief Justice Kang is
very interested in the upcoming trial.

219
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,019
Chief Justice Kang Sin-jin.

220
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:11,607
At least you won't die in confusion,
knowing who's behind it.

221
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:13,860
And let me tell you this
in case you're curious.

222
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:16,195
You know the money you hid

223
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:19,615
in the safe in the closet
of the care home? I took that all.

224
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,951
You saved quite a bit for a puppet.

225
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:24,370
What? What's wrong?

226
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,539
You can't even use that money
after you die.

227
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:27,623
What?

228
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,459
You piece of shit!

229
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:34,005
This is what happens
when a shithead tries to be a judge!

230
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:36,799
You should've just lived your life
as a piece of shit.

231
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,302
Who knows?
Maybe you could've been recycled.

232
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:41,721
You dumbass.

233
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:57,403
Take it as soon as you get there, alright?

234
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,278
Thanks for your hard work.

235
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:42,031
He's such a jerk, you know?

236
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,373
Emergency!

237
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:52,875
Call an ambulance!

238
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:54,961
Ambulance!

239
00:20:57,838 --> 00:20:59,715
I told you to take it
at the detention center.

240
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:01,884
Idiot.

241
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:05,680
His heartbeat and breathing are
very unstable.

242
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,139
- Please prepare gastric lavage.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:08,766
He's reacting to a drug.

244
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:11,102
- Where's the closest hospital?
- Within 15 minutes away.

245
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:19,277
Check on the patient in 30 minutes

246
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,987
- and let me know.
- Yes, sir.

247
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,759
Help!

248
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:47,847
Have you checked upstairs?

249
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,181
Contact the prison guard.

250
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:50,474
Sorry.

251
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:52,101
I told you to keep an eye on him!

252
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:01,277
I can't die a piece of shit.

253
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,334
Yes, Kim Yoon-hyeok speaking.

254
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:17,710
Go on.

255
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,328
CLOTHING DONATION BIN

256
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:40,579
- Who's that man?
- What is he doing?

257
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:26,875
The Seoul Metropolitan Council has passed

258
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,210
the 18th ordinance of 2025

259
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:30,879
to expel all the homeless on the streets

260
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:34,883
for improved city aesthetics
and public safety.

261
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,387
This has left the homeless

262
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,889
to hide in underpasses

263
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:43,058
abandoned buildings, and sewers.

264
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:19,595
Die!

265
00:27:19,678 --> 00:27:21,597
Die! What do you want?

266
00:27:32,232 --> 00:27:33,275
Dad.

267
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:35,277
Dad!

268
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:37,738
Dad!

269
00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:39,448
Please

270
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:41,492
save me.

271
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:11,146
This is where it ends.

272
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:33,979
It's so unfair to die like this.

273
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:36,106
When I've only begun

274
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:41,695
to want to live
as the real Lee Han-young now.

275
00:31:08,991 --> 00:31:10,075
Mother.

276
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:17,749
Mother.

277
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:59,207
I'm sorry, Mother.

278
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,651
Sorry.

279
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:31,156
I'm so sorry.

280
00:32:39,414 --> 00:32:40,499
Give me a chance.

281
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:42,167
Please give me a chance...

282
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,295
Mother, I'm sorry.

283
00:32:46,713 --> 00:32:49,132
I'm so sorry.

284
00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:55,222
Please. I'm sorry.

285
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,439
Defendant Lee Han-young.

286
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:10,445
Does this still feel unfair to you?

287
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:23,458
Do you still believe you're innocent?

288
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:27,212
I'm a cowardly son.

289
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:30,632
I'm a murderer.

290
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:41,810
I'm

291
00:33:42,728 --> 00:33:44,479
an accomplice with the devil.

292
00:33:46,898 --> 00:33:47,899
I'm

293
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:51,069
guilty.

294
00:33:57,409 --> 00:33:58,577
Defendant Lee Han-young is

295
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:03,999
guilty.

296
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,637
SHIN NAM-SUK

297
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:25,103
THE VICTIMS OF GOJIN CHEMICAL

298
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,564
PRESIDING JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

299
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,378
On April 20, 2025, around 1:30 a.m.

300
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:51,880
the Defendant attempted
to break into a home

301
00:34:51,963 --> 00:34:53,882
on Jeongeui-ro, Cheonan, Chungcheongnam-do

302
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:55,759
through a window

303
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:57,969
with the intention to steal
money and goods.

304
00:34:58,428 --> 00:35:00,514
However, the victim's boyfriend found him

305
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:01,932
leaving it as a theft attempt.

306
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,101
Your Honor, are you okay?

307
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:13,527
Your Honor.

308
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:16,154
Your Honor!

309
00:35:19,991 --> 00:35:21,118
Your Honor!

310
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:24,996
Huh?

311
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:29,209
Oh!

312
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:35,590
Huh?

313
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:45,934
- Oh!
- Huh?

314
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:47,936
He was the prosecutor for my first case.

315
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:49,020
That is all.

316
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:51,356
I heard about life flashing
before our eyes when dying.

317
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:53,275
I guess my flashback isn't over?

318
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,442
Your Honor.

319
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:57,904
Defendant Kim Sang-jin committed the crime

320
00:35:57,988 --> 00:35:59,322
out of impulse, in starvation.

321
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:00,532
Kim Sang-jin?

322
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:02,659
He admits to all his charges

323
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:05,036
and deeply regrets his actions.

324
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:09,541
Kim Sang-jin.

325
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,377
Kim Sang-jin.

326
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:15,714
Kim Sang-jin!

327
00:36:16,298 --> 00:36:17,465
What?

328
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:20,010
Kim Sang-jin, you son of a bitch.

329
00:36:20,093 --> 00:36:21,344
Your Honor.

330
00:36:22,846 --> 00:36:24,556
Your Honor, please calm down!

331
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,227
I still wake up from time to time
at the thought of you.

332
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:31,188
Why? It was just an attempted theft!

333
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:33,648
Theft, my ass! You know nothing.

334
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:36,067
Okay, hold on.

335
00:36:36,735 --> 00:36:38,153
Why do I sound like this?

336
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:41,656
Sure, this is my chance to get
all my anger out before I go, right?

337
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,161
Okay.

338
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:48,622
It's okay. I'm fine.

339
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:55,337
Hey, don't play dumb.
Look straight into my eyes.

340
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:07,515
I'm sorry.

341
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,229
Do you know what you've done? Yeah.

342
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:15,273
You know what you did.

343
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:17,567
Defendant Kim Sang-jin!

344
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:19,694
I sentence you to the death penalty!

345
00:37:24,783 --> 00:37:27,202
You know how much I wanted to do that?

346
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:28,453
You have no idea!

347
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,785
I'm ready!

348
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:10,078
Let's go!

349
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:12,080
Wherever it is, heaven or hell, I'm ready!

350
00:38:12,163 --> 00:38:13,164
Alright!

351
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:17,585
Yes!

352
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:27,846
Am I in hell?

353
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:28,930
Sure, then.

354
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:33,727
Alright, let's go!

355
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,228
Just go already.

356
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:37,480
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

357
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,541
Don't tell me I'm in hell.

358
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,501
Man.

359
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,712
I didn't think
I'd need to use the bathroom after death.

360
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:28,990
Is this some post-mortem service?

361
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:30,909
Wow!

362
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:33,495
I had these glasses ten years ago.

363
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:35,830
Watch your feet.

364
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:39,334
Stop getting in my way!

365
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,838
MAY 7, 2025

366
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:45,006
2025?

367
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:47,675
2025?

368
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,600
Wow!

369
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:01,439
Get your head away.

370
00:40:05,985 --> 00:40:07,529
No way.

371
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:12,283
Damn it!

372
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:13,451
"Damn it"?

373
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:15,537
If this is 2025

374
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,497
is this Lim Jeong-sik,
the Senior Presiding Judge?

375
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:20,083
Yes, sir.

376
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,709
Are you back in your right mind now?

377
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:23,795
Judge Lee

378
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:25,463
I know that was your first sole trial

379
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:26,881
but you went too far!

380
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,469
How can you sentence
an attempted theft to death?

381
00:40:31,594 --> 00:40:33,888
You think Kim Sang-jin is a serial killer?

382
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:34,973
How did you know?

383
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:36,057
You're still crazy.

384
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:37,725
Wake up!

385
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:40,103
You were fine as an accompanying judge.

386
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:42,564
I'll take care of this.
You'll be on probation.

387
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:44,899
- No, that's not it.
- Say that one more time!

388
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:48,987
Or I'll make
your first sole trial your last.

389
00:40:57,245 --> 00:40:59,497
Maybe this is for real.

390
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:02,500
Sir

391
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:04,919
is it 2025 this year?

392
00:41:05,003 --> 00:41:06,504
I'm taking a dump!

393
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:07,839
Just leave already!

394
00:41:07,922 --> 00:41:10,216
Why are you still talking?

395
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:12,343

COURT: CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

397
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:26,107
Stop it!

398
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:30,987
Can you just leave already?

399
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:39,120
Oh?

400
00:41:39,537 --> 00:41:40,788
Kim Yoon-hyeok?

401
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,709
Look at that.

402
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:47,712
What the hell did you do with my dad?

403
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,133
Take this as soon as you get there.

404
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:54,594
Whatever kills you,
it'll be recorded as an accident.

405
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:58,556
You piece of shit!

406
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,643
This is what happens
when a shithead tries to be a judge!

407
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:02,810
Huh?

408
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:08,316
You son of a bitch!

409
00:42:14,072 --> 00:42:15,823
Why?

410
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:19,869
This is before anything happened!

411
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:23,665
Oh, what?

412
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:25,333
You okay, Lee?

413
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:28,586
What's wrong? Are you okay?

414
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:32,549
I'm so thankful to have you
when nobody is here to help me!

415
00:42:32,632 --> 00:42:33,925
Hey.

416
00:42:34,008 --> 00:42:35,093
What's with you?

417
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:37,011
Did Mr. Lim scold you big time?

418
00:42:37,637 --> 00:42:39,347
In the bathroom.

419
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,641
Forgive him. You went too far.

420
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:43,518
Yeah, and what you did was

421
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:45,436
way beyond going too far.

422
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,604
Okay!

423
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,773
Alright.

424
00:43:05,373 --> 00:43:06,499
Let's see.

425
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:09,377
What do I do?

426
00:43:13,631 --> 00:43:14,632
What do I do now?

427
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:24,726
Oh, yes, Mother.

428
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:36,738
What brings the busy man to call,
Your Honor?

429
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:38,573
Are you out of food to eat?

430
00:43:46,831 --> 00:43:48,082
No

431
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,169
I just wanted to hear your voice, Mother.

432
00:43:52,503 --> 00:43:54,130
Huh? "Mother"?

433
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:56,174
Mother

434
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,051
you're healthy, right?

435
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:00,553
Are you taking your asthma meds?

436
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,388
And your inhaler.

437
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,476
You always have it on you, right?

438
00:44:11,272 --> 00:44:12,565
Who are you?

439
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:15,068
This is a scam, isn't it?

440
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:17,654
- Listen, my son is a judge.
- Mother, it's me.

441
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:19,656
How dare you try to scam a judge's mother?

442
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:22,241
You sound like a young man.

443
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:23,576
If you have time for scams

444
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,703
call and check on your mom instead.

445
00:44:25,787 --> 00:44:26,829
No, Mother, it's me.

446
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:29,999
I don't know who you are, alright?

447
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:33,920
My son has never called me "Mother"
in his life.

448
00:44:35,421 --> 00:44:36,589
Mother! Mom!

449
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:37,840
Mom!

450
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:41,594
- Mom...
- Crazy guy.

451
00:44:43,262 --> 00:44:44,681
What was that about asthma?

452
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:46,849
My Han-young

453
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:50,436
has never called me "Mother" in his life.

454
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,271
But wait.

455
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,275
He sounded just like him.

456
00:45:05,618 --> 00:45:06,619
Huh?

457
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:09,080
Oh!

458
00:45:09,163 --> 00:45:11,457
Oh, right!

459
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:16,379
This is before I started calling her
"Mother."

460
00:45:16,462 --> 00:45:17,547
MS. SHIN

461
00:45:18,172 --> 00:45:21,551
Right, this was before she got asthma.

462
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:24,470
Hello there, Ms. Shin!

463
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:26,389
That's my son, for sure.

464
00:45:26,472 --> 00:45:29,392
- Were you the one who called just now?
- No.

465
00:45:29,475 --> 00:45:30,893
Did something happen?

466
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,439

Ten years?

471
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:42,613
- Please.
- Let go!

472
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:45,241
Jang Tae-sik is
still just the owner of S Shopping now

473
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:48,411
and the Chairman of S Group is
his father, Jang Yong-hyeon.

474
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:51,372
S Shopping had a lot of issues
from tax evasion

475
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:53,082
to embezzlement and slush funds

476
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:54,500
but wiggled out every time.

Kang Sin-jin hasn't become

481
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:10,016
the Chief Justice yet, either.

482
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:11,100
Wow.

483
00:46:13,686 --> 00:46:14,812
Unbelievable.

484
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:16,439
How is this even possible?

485
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:20,777
I've come exactly ten years back in time.

486
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:33,039
Please

487
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:34,957
save me.

488
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:39,962
It's so unfair to die like this.

489
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:42,089
When I've only begun

490
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:46,511
to want to live
as the real Lee Han-young now.

491
00:46:47,386 --> 00:46:48,888
Defendant Lee Han-young is

492
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:50,431
guilty.

493
00:46:52,725 --> 00:46:53,726
That's right.

494
00:46:54,393 --> 00:46:57,730
I'm a sinner who wasted his life
by making wrong choices.

495
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:01,818
This means this life is a probation period

496
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,570
for Defendant Lee Han-young.

497
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,078
That means

498
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:14,997
I should straighten things out,
starting with Kim Sang-jin's case.

499
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,501
Gosh, my outfit.

500
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:20,503
Haven't worn these in forever.

501
00:47:31,013 --> 00:47:32,849
Wait, which car was mine?

502
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:35,518
My car back then was...

503
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,771
non-existent.

00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,463
But if this is 2025, I can still...

508
00:48:07,425 --> 00:48:09,719
- Jeong-ho.
- Hey!

509
00:48:09,802 --> 00:48:11,888
What brings my crazy judge to call?

510
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:15,433
You became a star
after moving to Chungcheongnam-do.

511
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:17,852
You know, you've gone viral
as "the crazy judge."

512
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:19,687
Did you call me to show off?

513
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,314
DEATH PENALTY FOR THE FAILED THIEF

514
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:22,773
What do you mean?

515
00:48:22,857 --> 00:48:25,568
You sentenced a thief to the death penalty

516
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:27,403
when he hadn't even eaten in three days.

517
00:48:27,486 --> 00:48:30,740
No wonder they call you "the crazy judge."

518
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:33,075
Kids don't want to become judges
because of you.

519
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:34,285
Hey!

520
00:48:34,368 --> 00:48:37,330
You just don't know who he really is.

521
00:48:37,413 --> 00:48:39,081
What don't I know?

522
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:40,875
He's just a petty, failed thief.

523
00:48:41,542 --> 00:48:42,835
Forget it.

524
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:44,337
Let me ask you a favor.

525
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,504
I need to get a used car.

526
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:46,756
Do you know anyone?

527
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,009
You didn't sound drunk
when we called yesterday.

528
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:51,302
- What?
- Remember?

529
00:48:51,385 --> 00:48:54,096
You already called me
about a used car yesterday.

530
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,264
Don't you remember?

531
00:48:56,098 --> 00:48:58,768
Oh, yeah, of course, I remember it.

532
00:48:58,851 --> 00:49:00,519
I'm just asking again.

533
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,730
- When will the car be ready?
- Tomorrow.

534
00:49:03,356 --> 00:49:04,941
Tomorrow? Tomorrow...

535
00:49:05,316 --> 00:49:07,026
Okay, sure.

536
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,028
Thanks.

537
00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:11,155
Hey, Han-young...

538
00:49:11,238 --> 00:49:12,531
Hey, Han-young...

539
00:49:16,535 --> 00:49:18,120
Maybe being a judge is tiring.

540
00:49:26,462 --> 00:49:28,881
Don't mess with the mayor, alright?

541
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:30,716
- Clean them up.
- Okay.

542
00:49:32,093 --> 00:49:33,094
Damn it.

543
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:51,112
Nobody had known it by this point

544
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:54,573
but Kim Sang-jin was a serial killer
who'd killed three people already.

545
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:57,660
But I fell for his tears

546
00:49:57,743 --> 00:49:59,495
and sentenced him to probation.

547
00:50:00,705 --> 00:50:02,665
I started getting nightmares

548
00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:04,792
because the guy I put on probation killed

549
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:07,670
yet another victim.

550
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:09,922
Sir...

551
00:50:19,098 --> 00:50:20,099
Huh?

552
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,018
Judge Lee!

553
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:26,230
Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo?
What are you doing here?

554
00:50:26,313 --> 00:50:27,773
What are you doing here?

555
00:50:28,232 --> 00:50:29,942
I'm here for a field inspection.

556
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:32,028
Don't you read case files?

557
00:50:32,111 --> 00:50:34,447
The site is the house near the terminal,
not here.

558
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:35,698
Why are you here?

559
00:50:36,073 --> 00:50:37,366
Well, no wonder.

560
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:41,495
How can you get in here?

561
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:43,122
Why would you go in?

562
00:50:43,205 --> 00:50:44,290
Why are you here, then?

563
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:45,541
Because you...

564
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:49,712
- You said you knew nothing!
- You scared me.

565
00:50:49,795 --> 00:50:52,173
You should be near the terminal,
at the crime scene.

566
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:53,466
Why are you here?

567
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:55,342
I asked you first.

568
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:58,387
Why don't you answer first, too, then?

569
00:50:58,471 --> 00:51:00,806
You already broke the Internet
as "the crazy judge."

570
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,475
I guess I'll add "rude" to that.

571
00:51:02,558 --> 00:51:05,061
We don't know if I'm the rude one yet.

572
00:51:05,144 --> 00:51:07,396
Aren't you also here
because something is fishy?

573
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,481
What's fishy?

574
00:51:08,564 --> 00:51:10,149
He climbed a wall out of hunger.

575
00:51:10,232 --> 00:51:11,484
I came to check just in case

576
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:13,569
but I doubt we'll find anything here.

577
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:14,820
What would we...

578
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:17,948
possibly find around here?

579
00:51:18,657 --> 00:51:19,658
Huh?

580
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:26,582
Oh?

581
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:42,973
- What are you, a princess?
- My gosh.

582
00:51:43,057 --> 00:51:44,100
Let me do it.

583
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:56,821
Just like this.

584
00:51:57,613 --> 00:51:59,532
- Easy. All good.
- Wow.

585
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:02,743
See? Easy.

586
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:04,620
Isn't this property damage?

587
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:08,124
I wouldn't call it "damage."
Nothing's broken.

588
00:52:08,207 --> 00:52:09,208
Without a warrant?

589
00:52:12,044 --> 00:52:14,213
Anyway, since you took it off,
get the door for me.

590
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,725
I shouldn't have colluded with him.

591
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:28,477
This is crazy.

592
00:52:38,863 --> 00:52:40,489
What are you possibly trying to find?

593
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,741
You've dealt with violent crimes, right?

594
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:44,493
Of course.

595
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:50,749
I'm opening it.

596
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:52,418
One

597
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:54,295
two

598
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:57,673
three!

599
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:01,802
Goodness!

600
00:53:07,975 --> 00:53:10,352
Corpses.

601
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,105
What are corpses doing here?

602
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:17,860
Let go! My goodness.

603
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:21,906
Corpses...

604
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:25,201
There's something inside! What is it?

605
00:53:25,784 --> 00:53:27,620
It's almost open.

606
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,372
- Oh? Hold on.
- Why?

607
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:35,920
What?

608
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:40,216
Huh?

609
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,676
Do you just like to scream

610
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,303
- every time you open a fridge?
- It's not here.

611
00:53:44,386 --> 00:53:45,387
It should be here.

612
00:53:45,471 --> 00:53:46,889
What are you even looking for?

613
00:53:46,972 --> 00:53:49,350
Stop asking me questions
and start looking!

614
00:53:49,433 --> 00:53:50,434
Whatever!

615
00:53:51,101 --> 00:53:52,478
I thought these were bones!

616
00:53:53,145 --> 00:53:54,730
You're not explaining anything!

617
00:53:57,191 --> 00:54:00,236
I must find proof
that Kim Sang-jin is a serial killer.

618
00:54:00,694 --> 00:54:01,779
His third murder happened

619
00:54:01,862 --> 00:54:03,822
three days before getting arrested
for attempted theft.

620
00:54:03,906 --> 00:54:05,282
And it was recorded

621
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:07,576
that the victim was found in the fridge.

622
00:54:11,747 --> 00:54:14,083
That's enough. Come back out now.

623
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:17,670
Before we get caught
for breaking in and property damage.

624
00:54:18,045 --> 00:54:19,088
Come out.

625
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:23,801
BLEACH

626
00:54:32,142 --> 00:54:36,105
Could he have had a temporary place
for keeping his corpses?

627
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:39,066
BLEACH

628
00:54:39,149 --> 00:54:40,651
PURE BLEACH

629
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,861
That's a different brand.

630
00:54:43,487 --> 00:54:46,365
Why are people in this area so serious
about house cleaning?

631
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,702
Is that death sentence-worthy, too?

632
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,622
I didn't know
you were the type to hold grudges.

633
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:56,000
Do you even know me?

634
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,127
No, I just get a vibe.

635
00:55:09,555 --> 00:55:12,057
What's with those hands behind his back
like an old man?

636
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,397
That's a good counterstrike.

637
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,692
Good choice! Good eye.

638
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:23,319
This is what I find disappointing.

639
00:55:23,402 --> 00:55:26,864
What if he'd taken some swings
before this?

640
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:28,073
You an Eagles fan?

641
00:55:29,742 --> 00:55:30,909
How did you know?

642
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:37,833
I'm here because you said you'd pay,
but I'm leaving right away.

643
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:39,918
I don't want to have anything
to do with you...

644
00:55:40,836 --> 00:55:41,837
Hey!

645
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:43,797
Hey!

646
00:55:43,881 --> 00:55:45,257
Oh, my gosh!

647
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,633
That was...

648
00:55:46,717 --> 00:55:48,218
Another out at first base!

649
00:55:48,302 --> 00:55:50,679
It's okay. The Eagles will win, anyway.

650
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:52,431
But it'll go overtime.

651
00:55:52,514 --> 00:55:54,266
A walk-off home run
in the bottom of the 11th.

652
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,768
The Eagles wins.

653
00:55:57,311 --> 00:55:58,604
Are you spreading false information?

654
00:55:58,687 --> 00:55:59,688
You want to bet?

655
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:02,941
The loser has to grant the winner's wish,
no matter what.

656
00:56:08,405 --> 00:56:09,406
You down?

657
00:56:11,784 --> 00:56:12,785
Down?

658
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:16,080
- Down.
- Water.

659
00:56:16,413 --> 00:56:18,040
DISABLED THE DOOR LOCK SOUND

660
00:56:18,457 --> 00:56:19,541
THE ALIBI AND THE FACTS MATCH

661
00:56:25,172 --> 00:56:27,341
All of this is about theft.

662
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:40,145
No.

663
00:56:40,854 --> 00:56:43,399
The third victim's body was
definitely found

664
00:56:43,482 --> 00:56:45,442
in the fridge.

665
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:48,654
Was the case record wrong?

666
00:56:50,114 --> 00:56:51,115
No.

667
00:56:51,698 --> 00:56:55,369
From what I remember,
there were even photos from the site.

668
00:57:36,076 --> 00:57:37,411
Unbelievable.

669
00:57:37,828 --> 00:57:39,955
It's like he's lost his mind.

670
00:57:43,834 --> 00:57:45,169
Good morning.

671
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:48,005
Hey.

672
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:50,424
Was he here all night?

673
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:52,926
It seems like it.

674
00:57:54,261 --> 00:57:55,971
Why did he sentence him
to the death penalty?

675
00:57:57,681 --> 00:57:59,516
I'm not really sure, either.

676
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:02,769
Weren't you classmates?

677
00:58:03,353 --> 00:58:04,354
Yes, sir.

678
00:58:05,772 --> 00:58:07,232
Tell him to come to my office
after breakfast.

679
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:10,611
Come on. It's too early for this.

680
00:58:11,361 --> 00:58:13,155
My stomach has been so upset lately.

681
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,199
Tell him to come to my office.

682
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:16,283
Yes, sir.

683
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:19,495
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

684
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:27,211
It's too early for something so gross.

685
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,547
Why does he keep coming here?
It's so awkward.

686
00:58:37,554 --> 00:58:39,139
It's the good Kim Yoon-hyeok.

687
00:58:39,223 --> 00:58:40,933
I know I'm a good person.

688
00:58:42,267 --> 00:58:43,477
Did you sleep here?

689
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:44,645
Yeah.

690
00:58:46,563 --> 00:58:48,440
Mr. Lim wants to see you in his office.

691
00:58:49,107 --> 00:58:50,150
Okay.

692
00:59:01,411 --> 00:59:04,665
It hasn't changed a bit.

693
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:18,762
It's all the same.

694
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:23,517
Look at the phone.

695
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,436
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

696
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:30,524
Are you kidding?

697
00:59:34,027 --> 00:59:35,195
Did you call me, sir?

698
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:45,664
I'll close the door for you.

699
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:48,584
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

700
00:59:51,837 --> 00:59:53,338
Gosh, you startled me.

701
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:04,433
Acting like a presiding judge
means nothing.

702
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:07,603
Keep causing trouble from the start

703
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:10,272
and you'll spend your whole career
moving around regional courts.

704
01:00:10,355 --> 01:00:11,690
I know Chief Judge Baek Yi-seok

705
01:00:11,773 --> 01:00:13,567
got on the wrong side of the higher-ups
and came here

706
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,110
but you need to move up to Seoul.

707
01:00:16,778 --> 01:00:18,113
What's your plan for Kim?

708
01:00:20,741 --> 01:00:22,659
It was a theft attempt out of hunger.

709
01:00:22,743 --> 01:00:25,537
I'll make an appropriate verdict
as per the standards.

710
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:27,456
You're not crazy now?

711
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,335
Please continue

712
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:35,339
to supervise me with a critical eye.

713
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:39,593
Taking over the Internet as a judge is
an experience, too.

714
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,054
Let me know anytime if you want attention.

715
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:43,388
I'll give you some.

716
01:00:43,764 --> 01:00:44,765
Yes, sir!

717
01:00:47,934 --> 01:00:48,935
You may leave.

718
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:08,622
Why do I still feel like something is off?

719
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:10,540
The verdict is ready.

720
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:12,959
I sentence Defendant Kim Sang-jin

721
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:15,003
to one year in prison.

722
01:01:15,545 --> 01:01:16,546
However

723
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,383
the court grants probation of two years

724
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:21,426
starting from the date
of the final judgment.

725
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:28,725
DEFENDANT

726
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:46,576
Where have I seen him?

727
01:01:47,994 --> 01:01:49,246
- He's coming.
- Judge Lee!

728
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:51,331
Judge Lee.

729
01:01:51,415 --> 01:01:52,916
It was the death penalty last time.

730
01:01:52,999 --> 01:01:54,668
Isn't a year in prison
and two on probation

731
01:01:54,751 --> 01:01:56,253
too dramatic?

732
01:01:56,586 --> 01:01:58,755
My verdict last time was more dramatic.

733
01:01:59,214 --> 01:02:02,426
I sincerely apologize as a judge

734
01:02:02,676 --> 01:02:04,344
who should make fair, logical judgment.

735
01:02:06,513 --> 01:02:08,432
- Oh, I...
- Let's wrap it up here.

736
01:02:08,515 --> 01:02:09,725
Has everyone eaten?

737
01:02:10,767 --> 01:02:13,145
Eat something and get some rest.

738
01:02:13,478 --> 01:02:14,604
Excuse me, then.

739
01:02:17,649 --> 01:02:18,942
Look at that charisma.

740
01:02:19,693 --> 01:02:21,403
Was that a presiding judge just now?

741
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,280
Wasn't that his first sole trial?

742
01:02:24,114 --> 01:02:25,574
Hey, did we get a photo of him?

743
01:02:25,657 --> 01:02:27,117
- Hold on.
- Darn it!

744
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,827
Let's go.

745
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:48,305
He really has a killer smile.

746
01:02:54,686 --> 01:02:57,105
Judge Lee, please let us take
a photo of you.

747
01:03:06,823 --> 01:03:10,410
- Any word for the bereaved?
- Look this way!

748
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:15,332
It's her! Kang Ju-yeong.

749
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,630
It's the kimchi fridge.

750
01:03:21,713 --> 01:03:24,591
Kim Sang-jin's third victim was found
in a kimchi fridge

751
01:03:24,674 --> 01:03:26,259
for a horrifying reason.

752
01:03:26,343 --> 01:03:28,345
I was dispatched
to fix the air conditioner

753
01:03:28,428 --> 01:03:29,971
in the main bedroom

754
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:32,849
and the kimchi fridge was blocking
the outdoor unit.

755
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:35,602
So, I tried to push it a bit to the side

756
01:03:35,894 --> 01:03:37,854
- and the woman freaked out.
- Why won't it move?

757
01:03:37,938 --> 01:03:39,606
- What's inside that it's so heavy?
- And

758
01:03:40,065 --> 01:03:41,733
it was odd to see the fridge

759
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:44,152
- in their bedroom.
- Please don't touch this.

760
01:03:44,236 --> 01:03:46,279
She made such a big deal about it

761
01:03:46,363 --> 01:03:47,489
so I got curious.

762
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:50,575
So, when she went to the bathroom

763
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:52,702
I secretly opened it.

764
01:03:54,412 --> 01:03:55,539
I was mortified.

765
01:04:07,634 --> 01:04:09,302
What?

766
01:04:09,886 --> 01:04:11,012
Hey!

767
01:04:30,824 --> 01:04:31,992
Ha-yeon!

768
01:04:32,576 --> 01:04:33,827
Did you have fun?

769
01:04:34,828 --> 01:04:37,205
Ha-yeon, let's eat dinner at home

770
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:38,498
and come back out to play.

771
01:04:38,582 --> 01:04:40,375
- Okay, Mommy.
- Shake your hands off.

772
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,085
Don't forget your things.

773
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:44,921
Let's go. Hold my hand.

774
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:46,423
Let's go. Good girl.

775
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,841
Look at it.

776
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:51,344
This car comes at a used car price

777
01:04:51,428 --> 01:04:52,971
but it's as good as new.

778
01:04:53,054 --> 01:04:54,097
There's a scratch.

779
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,474
I mean, it's almost new.

780
01:04:57,142 --> 01:04:59,603
Please put in a good word for me

781
01:04:59,686 --> 01:05:01,104
to Jeong-ho, the angel.

782
01:05:01,187 --> 01:05:02,188
- Sure.
- Thanks.

783
01:05:02,272 --> 01:05:04,691
ILJJA MART

784
01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:22,667
Hello.

785
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:24,127
Oh, hello.

786
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:25,462
Could I ask you a question?

787
01:05:25,545 --> 01:05:26,546
- Sure.
- Has anyone

788
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,214
come by to buy these in bulk?

789
01:05:28,298 --> 01:05:29,299
Oh...

790
01:05:30,383 --> 01:05:31,384
I'm not sure.

791
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:33,887
What do they look like?

792
01:05:34,054 --> 01:05:36,640
She had a hat on, so I'm not sure.
It was a woman.

793
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:39,142
I'm not sure.

794
01:05:39,225 --> 01:05:40,393
This is the brand.

795
01:05:40,477 --> 01:05:41,728
We don't carry that.

796
01:05:43,063 --> 01:05:44,564
- Okay, then.
- Have a good day.

797
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:45,732
Thank you.

798
01:05:46,483 --> 01:05:48,485
- Hello, Prosecutor Park.
- Hey.

799
01:05:48,818 --> 01:05:51,154
Sang-jin won't move
an inch out of his house.

800
01:05:51,237 --> 01:05:52,489
Forget that.

801
01:05:52,822 --> 01:05:54,407
Yesterday's game wasn't a rerun.

802
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:55,492
How did you know?

803
01:05:56,618 --> 01:05:59,704
And it goes all the way to the left!

804
01:05:59,788 --> 01:06:02,248
And it keeps going!

805
01:06:02,332 --> 01:06:03,333
Yes!

806
01:06:04,834 --> 01:06:06,252
- Huh?
- Another home run!

807
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:08,797
I was just stating my hope. I guessed.

808
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:11,424
Anyway, don't lose sight of Sang-jin.

809
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:16,596
Because that match made me become
an Eagles fan.

810
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:22,644
We're leaving tonight. Get ready.

811
01:06:27,023 --> 01:06:29,776
DALLAE APARTMENT

812
01:06:32,278 --> 01:06:33,947
Sang-jin is outside.

813
01:06:35,156 --> 01:06:37,075
Kim Sang-jin is a serial killer.

814
01:06:37,158 --> 01:06:38,952
He'll kill a six-year-old girl today...

815
01:06:39,661 --> 01:06:40,662
No.

816
01:06:42,288 --> 01:06:43,957
I can't let the kid die again.

817
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,250
KIM SANG-JIN IS A SERIAL KILLER

818
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:48,294
Excuse me!

819
01:06:48,378 --> 01:06:51,339
There was a woman who bought
loads of something else.

820
01:07:03,476 --> 01:07:06,563
- Ms. Kang Ju-yeong.
- She almost became Kim's third target.

821
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:08,940
I know you're being blackmailed
by Mr. Kim Sang-jin.

822
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:10,817
Another victim.

823
01:07:15,697 --> 01:07:16,740
Ms. Kang.

824
01:07:20,744 --> 01:07:21,786
I know it all.

825
01:07:22,078 --> 01:07:23,621
You have no choice but to obey him

826
01:07:23,705 --> 01:07:25,749
because he's threatening to kill

827
01:07:25,832 --> 01:07:27,584
your mother and niece
working at the market.

828
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:30,503
I'm so sorry.

829
01:07:30,587 --> 01:07:32,464
- Please forgive me.
- Please open the door.

830
01:07:32,547 --> 01:07:35,717
I'm so sorry.

831
01:08:03,787 --> 01:08:05,371
I'm sorry.

832
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:06,998
I'm sorry.

833
01:08:07,207 --> 01:08:09,709
I'm so sorry.

834
01:08:10,835 --> 01:08:11,878
It's okay.

835
01:08:12,378 --> 01:08:13,379
You'll be okay.

836
01:08:14,214 --> 01:08:16,049
I should've died then.

837
01:08:16,299 --> 01:08:18,384
I should've let him kill me.

838
01:08:18,468 --> 01:08:19,886
I should've died!

839
01:08:30,647 --> 01:08:31,981
What's wrong? Are you okay?

840
01:08:32,065 --> 01:08:33,733
Please save me.

841
01:08:33,817 --> 01:08:35,318
Hold on.

842
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:51,334
Your Honor

843
01:08:51,918 --> 01:08:53,336
please give me the death penalty.

844
01:08:54,504 --> 01:08:56,131
I deserve to die.

845
01:08:56,756 --> 01:08:59,092
No, why should you die?

846
01:08:59,384 --> 01:09:01,177
You sentenced him to the death penalty

847
01:09:01,261 --> 01:09:02,554
but you let him out.

848
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:04,180
Why did you do that?

849
01:09:04,264 --> 01:09:06,015
Why did you lie?

850
01:09:07,433 --> 01:09:11,855
Now, he'll kill my mom and niece, too.

851
01:09:13,314 --> 01:09:14,691
I didn't lie.

852
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,570
I let him go to get him for good.

853
01:09:19,612 --> 01:09:21,156
To arrest him for murder charges

854
01:09:21,906 --> 01:09:23,408
instead of mere housebreaking.

855
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:26,411
So

856
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:31,166
trust me.

857
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:41,176
- Ye-na.
- Yes?

858
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:42,260
It's dinnertime.

859
01:09:42,343 --> 01:09:43,761
- Hey, come on.
- Hurry.

860
01:09:58,318 --> 01:10:00,778
Sang-jin is at a nearby playground.

861
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,866
I'm done after this.

862
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:07,368
- As for the rest...
- Arrest him right now.

863
01:10:07,785 --> 01:10:08,786
You're kidding!

864
01:10:09,287 --> 01:10:10,455
Have you gone mad?

865
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:12,624
For what do I arrest a man

866
01:10:12,707 --> 01:10:13,958
just eating snacks at a park?

867
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:16,461
Did you not see my text?

868
01:10:16,544 --> 01:10:18,922
Yeah, about him being a serial killer.

869
01:10:19,339 --> 01:10:20,715
Are you still onto that?

870
01:10:21,633 --> 01:10:22,634
There's a girl in a duck shirt

871
01:10:22,717 --> 01:10:24,219
at the playground, right?

872
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:29,641
How did you know?

873
01:10:29,724 --> 01:10:30,725
Where are you?

874
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:32,477
Arrest him right now.

875
01:10:33,311 --> 01:10:34,562
Or she'll die.

876
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,569
What nonsense are you...

877
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:43,655
saying?

878
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,911
He called me.

879
01:10:50,828 --> 01:10:51,996
Don't worry.

880
01:10:52,121 --> 01:10:55,208
I'll make sure
he can never call you again.

881
01:11:01,881 --> 01:11:02,966
Did you arrest him?

882
01:11:08,429 --> 01:11:10,014
He seemed to be on his phone

883
01:11:10,098 --> 01:11:11,266
and suddenly ran away.

884
01:11:11,641 --> 01:11:14,018
I'm chasing after him,
but are you sure he's a murderer?

885
01:11:14,102 --> 01:11:16,229
Don't let him go. Get him, no matter what.

886
01:11:16,312 --> 01:11:17,355
Fine.

887
01:11:19,899 --> 01:11:20,942
Are there spy cams here?

888
01:11:22,527 --> 01:11:23,528
The teddy!

889
01:11:29,284 --> 01:11:30,368
I forgot

890
01:11:31,035 --> 01:11:32,620
that he'd openly installed spy cams

891
01:11:32,704 --> 01:11:34,539
to threaten Kang Ju-yeong.

892
01:11:35,873 --> 01:11:37,041
Where are you right now?

893
01:11:43,631 --> 01:11:44,924
A very steep set of stairs.

894
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,071
And now?

895
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:10,825
On my way down after reaching the top.

896
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:15,330
Do you know where he is?

897
01:12:16,289 --> 01:12:18,916
He's going to kill my mom and niece.

898
01:12:19,584 --> 01:12:21,085
Please, sir.

899
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:22,670
I have to see my mom.

900
01:12:22,754 --> 01:12:24,630
Please let me go to my mom!

901
01:12:24,714 --> 01:12:27,550
That's right. I'm a judge.

902
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:29,886
So

903
01:12:30,428 --> 01:12:32,388
let's put Sang-jin on trial together.

904
01:12:33,097 --> 01:12:35,933
So that he can never mess
with your mother or niece.

905
01:12:42,482 --> 01:12:44,025
Do you know the way down?

906
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:18,559
Ju-yeong, repeat it out loud after me.

907
01:13:19,977 --> 01:13:21,896
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin...

908
01:13:24,941 --> 01:13:27,068
"The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin..."

909
01:13:27,151 --> 01:13:29,153
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

910
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:32,198
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

911
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,575
Say it louder!

912
01:13:36,035 --> 01:13:37,870
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

913
01:13:37,954 --> 01:13:38,955
Even louder!

914
01:13:40,331 --> 01:13:42,500
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

915
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:44,502
To death!

916
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,672
To death!

917
01:13:52,093 --> 01:13:53,719
So ordered!

918
01:14:27,253 --> 01:14:30,840
THE JUDGE RETURNS

919
01:14:54,906 --> 01:14:56,115
A judge shouldn't do this.

920
01:14:56,199 --> 01:14:57,408
Do I have to be nice, too?

921
01:14:57,492 --> 01:14:58,659
Whatever it is

922
01:14:58,743 --> 01:15:00,244
don't you know
all court decisions are recorded?

923
01:15:00,328 --> 01:15:02,413
I hear there's an interesting judge
at the Chungnam Court.

924
01:15:02,497 --> 01:15:04,665
Find a case and assign it to Judge Lee.

925
01:15:04,749 --> 01:15:07,710
A bride-to-be died in a car accident.

926
01:15:07,793 --> 01:15:09,253
At first, I thought it was an accident.

927
01:15:09,337 --> 01:15:10,755
The issue is, all her insurances had

928
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:12,340
an assigned beneficiary.

929
01:15:12,798 --> 01:15:14,884
Bring my Seong-hui back to life!

930
01:15:14,967 --> 01:15:16,594
Do your job! You're a judge!

931
01:15:16,677 --> 01:15:18,095
Do you think Park Hyeok-jun really did it?

932
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:20,973
Success ends quickly
without a good leader.

933
01:15:21,057 --> 01:15:22,225
Who are you, really?

934
01:15:22,308 --> 01:15:23,434
Are you a real judge?

935
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:28,439
