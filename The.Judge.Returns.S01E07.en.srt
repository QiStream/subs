1
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,908
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:38,245
EPISODE 7

3
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:39,955
Move your foot.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,082
Your foot!

5
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,590
The thing is, Dong-gi has to stay healthy

6
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:51,341
without a single paper cut

7
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,093
or a random bruise.

8
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:56,013
Because if he doesn't pay me back,
I own him.

9
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:57,639
So

10
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,768
don't you dare lay a finger on him,
or else...

11
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:02,603
Alright?

12
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:16,700
I want him

13
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:19,578
to die.

14
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,039
Kill him.

15
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:23,415
Kill him!

16
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:26,919
I can finally hear you.

17
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:42,851
No!

18
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:01,954
Defendant Chu Yong-jin

19
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:04,957
the court hereby sentences you to death.

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,882
No!

21
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,177
Wait!

22
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:27,938
Let him out.

23
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:29,940
Just let him go.

24
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:32,151
Let him go!

25
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:34,611
Let him out...

26
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:04,850
Are you sure you won't regret it?

27
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:10,105
He never apologized to my son sincerely.

28
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,942
He'd apologize a million times
as long as he doesn't have to mean it.

29
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:17,070
He'd also beg a billion times
if it played in his favor.

30
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:18,155
I'm not asking

31
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:21,366
for him to be freed
for an insincere apology, either.

32
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:23,619
What I want is

33
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,955
for him and the world to know

34
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:30,459
the crimes he has committed.

35
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,756
Do you really want Mr. Chu to be tried?

36
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,635
Do you believe in the law?

37
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,680
Even when we've

38
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,683
finally got him in a sinkhole?

39
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,564
I can't help but think

40
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:56,026
about what good would come

41
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,569
from just burying him alive.

42
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,324
I guess we'll take him to the court, then.

43
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:06,453
I'm glad.

44
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:09,414
I know the law very well.

45
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:14,253
Nice to meet you.

46
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:16,213
I'm Judge Lee Han Young

47
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:18,590
at the Seoul Central District Court.

48
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,102
Are you okay, boss?

49
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:32,771
It stings!

50
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,190
Sorry, sir.

51
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:38,151
Be more gentle with it!

52
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,778
Damn it.

53
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:43,615
I can still feel sand in my mouth.

54
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:45,993
Hak-su.

55
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:47,452
Yes, boss.

56
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:50,372
Keep an eye on Dong-gi
at all times from now on.

57
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:53,166
Those bastards are loansharks.

58
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,043
When they come to take his money

59
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,630
chop off a limb or something

60
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:00,382
and bring them here, alright?

61
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:02,718
Yes, boss.

62
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,062
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE

63
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,320
Yes, Mr. Kang.

64
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,492
Hot!

65
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,702
Ta-da!

66
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:30,495
Wow, this is...

67
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,580
I know, right?

68
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:33,248
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,000
I only cooked this for myself.

70
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,543
Want me to cook some more?

71
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:38,253
Of course! This is nothing!

72
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,755
Right? We need more?

73
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,131
I have leftover rice.

74
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:42,382
It's fine.

75
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,677
Gosh, this looks so good.

76
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,309
How's Na-yeong doing?

77
00:05:58,315 --> 00:05:59,399
She's doing well, right?

78
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,862
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

79
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,700
She insisted on working
just until midnight.

80
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,077
I lost to her.

81
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,371
She thinks she owns the place.

82
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,081
So, you got shown up by a kid?

83
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:15,415
Does she look like a kid?

84
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:16,666
She'll beat you anytime.

85
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,126
I'm a judge.

86
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,337
Other people's words can't sway me.

87
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,422
- Sure, whatever.
- Hello.

88
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,842
You can't be around drunk people.
It's not safe.

89
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:26,968
Just work on weekdays.

90
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:30,097
If I move to another province for college,
I'll have to rent.

91
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,598
I don't have money for that

92
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:33,517
meaning I have to go
to a college in Seoul.

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,644
And night shifts are perfect for studying.

94
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,354
But it's still dangerous.

95
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,606
But going to an out-of-state college is
more dangerous.

96
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:41,149
Yeah, it is.

97
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,026
Did your grandma approve?

98
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,821
I told her I'd have to move for college
if I didn't study now

99
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:47,197
and she immediately said okay.

100
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,952
You have a permit
for her to work at night?

101
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:53,787
Oh, man, that's too complicated.

102
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:56,081
So, you don't have it?

103
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:01,044
NIGHT WORK PERMIT FOR MINORS

104
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:04,798
No, we went through the complicated stuff
and got it.

105
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,383
Yeah, complicated, baby!

106
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:08,885
You're even worse.

107
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:10,720
A judge is only human, huh?

108
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,231
Walk Na-yeong home.

109
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,191
People are drunk. It's dangerous.

110
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,609
Do you need a bag?

111
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:29,448
Sir, do you need a bag?

112
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:41,001
Grandma sleeps with the lights on

113
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:42,794
so it's safer for me to walk home.

114
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:46,256
She doesn't even turn the fan on

115
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,675
to save on electricity bills
when she's alone.

116
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,345
There's an air conditioner
at my parents' junkyard.

117
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:53,847
Should I set that up at yours?

118
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:57,017
She doesn't even use the fan
because electricity is expensive.

119
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,936
Oh, right.

120
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,315
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodbye.

121
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:04,566
Goodnight.

122
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,259
Grandma.

123
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,305
Hey.

124
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:37,933
There's my little puppy.

125
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:40,602
- Grandma.
- Yeah?

126
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:43,480
You know what I love most
about having a part-time job?

127
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,359
Making money?

128
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:51,863
No, having the store owner walk me home.

129
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:55,575
Knowing that there's an adult with me

130
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:57,744
as I walk in the dark

131
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:00,497
makes me want to be a better person.

132
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:10,549
Grandma.

133
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,573
Looks like you won't need to sleep
with the lights on anymore.

134
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,007
Hey, don't push!

135
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,470
Why are you pulling?

136
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,805
Stop pushing me!

137
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,140
When did I do that?

138
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:01,516
Let's go again.

139
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,026
What's that, anyway?

140
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:12,736
Huh? This?

141
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,696
I didn't know what would fit.

142
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,407
You're an idiot.

143
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,576
You're a judge,
and a teenager beat you, so...

144
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:24,080
By the way, it looks like the repair
will cost more than the car.

145
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:29,002
Let me know if you can't afford it.

146
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:30,253
Your friend's a loan shark.

147
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,307
- Your Honor!
- Oh, gosh.

148
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:43,975
Good morning!

149
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:45,977
Who are you?

150
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:47,937
Angel!

151
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:50,649
Oh, you brought the car
from the Chungnam Court!

152
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,651
What brings you here?

153
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:57,530
I got it right from the dealership.
It's an express delivery.

154
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,287
Damn, Jeong-ho.

155
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:07,624
So, how do you like it?

156
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,086
I love it.

157
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:13,421
It's so spacious,
and the seat is so cushy.

158
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:14,506
Hey

159
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,425
you can pay in 60 installments.
That's doable on your meager salary.

160
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,885
Over 60 months?

161
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,390
You're hilarious.

162
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,975
Good job.

163
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,770
So, why did you choose such a big car?

164
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:38,905
Are you still handling things
with your fists?

165
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,491
No, sir.

166
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,285
I've never done that
since you helped me become

167
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:46,121
the District Mayor.

168
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:47,664
Exactly!

169
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:50,583
I made you the District Mayor

170
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:53,169
so you owe me, big time.

171
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,171
Yes, sir.

172
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:57,590
So, why is it so hard to get the victims

173
00:11:57,882 --> 00:11:59,467
to sign a damn settlement deal?

174
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,387
Sorry, sir.

175
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,514
I'll get it done as soon as possible.

176
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:08,893
Don't you go trying to play lawyer

177
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,063
and act like a real District Mayor
because you think you're one.

178
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,858
Just stick to your best expertise.

179
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,402
You know what I mean!

180
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:19,863
Yes, sir.

181
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:21,656
I'll do that.

182
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:23,992
CALL RECORD FROM THE SECOND CALL TO 911

183
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:26,786
911: HELLO, 911 EMERGENCY
CALLER: OH... THIS IS...UH...

184
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,181
How's it going with the sinkhole case?

185
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,060
If it were going well, how would it look?

186
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:54,898
There'd be nothing to consider

187
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:56,983
and no questions unanswered.

188
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,694
I guess it's not going well, then.

189
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:04,491
Let me know if I can help you.

190
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,424
How's Judge Lee doing?

191
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,430
He's busy with the sinkhole case.

192
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,391
He hasn't done much else.

193
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,777
WOO GYO-HUN

194
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,654
AN INTENSE CONFIRMATION HEARING EXPECTED

195
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:43,988
WOO GYO-HUN STAYS SILENT
ABOUT STOCK PARKING ALLEGATIONS

196
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,281
ARGUMENTS OVER FALSIFIED RESIDENCY

197
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:46,950
WOO GYO-HUN REVEALS
HIS QUESTIONABLE FINANCES

198
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:49,118
ALLEGATIONS OF UNFAIR HIRING PRACTICES
BY WOO GYO-HUN

199
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:52,705
Still no movement
from Prosecutor General Eom.

200
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,336
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a
from the Central District Office.

201
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,631
She recently arrested Jang Tae-sik,
the CEO of S Shopping.

202
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:05,176
She'd also tear Mr. Woo apart
in a heartbeat.

203
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:12,892
Mr. Woo!

204
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,853
Did you falsify your residence?

205
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,028
My daughter had depression

206
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,823
in middle school.

207
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,326
She had one friend whom she could trust

208
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,663
but they ended up at different schools
for high school.

209
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:37,208
To help her move to her friend's school...

210
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,051
Regardless of my reason

211
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,721
I shouldn't have done so
as a public servant.

212
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,767
I'd like to take this chance
to apologize to the nation sincerely.

213
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:01,983
Coming through.

214
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:04,027
Do you admit to stock parking

215
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,070
making your brother-in-law keep
your stocks?

216
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:07,739
Where are you from?

217
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:09,574
I'm Reporter Han Jeong-won from YTM.

218
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:12,327
And you believe in fake news

219
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,495
when you're
from such an established agency?

220
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,289
I don't know what to say.

221
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:18,249
WOO GYO-HUN DISMISSES "STOCK PARKING"
CONTROVERSY AS FAKE NEWS

222
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,085
Anyway, I'll clarify everything

223
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,129
at the confirmation hearing. Bye.

224
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:25,006
- Excuse me!
- Mr. Woo!

225
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,550
Did you come up with that?

226
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:30,678
No, he's quick enough to answer that much.

227
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,013
What about the stock parking?

228
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:35,558
I had a civil organization expose him

229
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,602
so he can just say
it's under investigation.

230
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,396
Once he gets named the Minister of Justice

231
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,607
they'll drop the charges.

232
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:43,942
Sin-jin

233
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:47,528
why do you think I've chosen Gyo-hun?

234
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:51,324
Gyo-hun is full of flaws
but also full of greed.

235
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,952
He'll strike or keep whomever you choose

236
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:57,288
in the next presidential election season.

237
00:15:58,414 --> 00:15:59,499
In return

238
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,835
you'll keep quiet about his shortcomings

239
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,545
and give him what he wants.

240
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:10,176
And what do you want?

241
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,932
Justice in the Judiciary.

242
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:19,686
That's very ambitious.

243
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:29,362
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

244
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:35,952
Judge Lee lived

245
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:38,830
in Mak-dong, Yeongdeungpo District
throughout his school years.

246
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:40,540
His grades were alright

247
00:16:40,623 --> 00:16:42,834
up to 11th grade

248
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:44,377
but in 12th grade

249
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,547
he suddenly started getting top grades.

250
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:50,883
Thanks to that, he was accepted
into a small, regional law school.

251
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:54,846
There's always a reason

252
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:57,140
for anyone's dramatic change.

253
00:16:57,724 --> 00:16:58,808
Yes, sir.

254
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:00,309
When he entered 12th grade

255
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:03,021
Mak-dong was designated
as a redevelopment zone.

256
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:05,481
It was then that his father fought

257
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,483
a guard from the construction company

258
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:10,236
and was sentenced to 1.5 years in jail
for aggravated assault.

259
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,282
YEONGDEUNGPO DISTRICT, A SUSTAINABLE CITY

260
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,201
CONTRACTOR FOR PROJECT

261
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:19,746
CONTRACTOR: S CONSTRUCTION

262
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,047
What a coincidence.

263
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:32,800
To think it was Judge Lee's father,
of all people.

264
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:52,028
Case Number 2007GH5432.

265
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:53,863
The verdict for Defendant Lee Bong-seok

266
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:56,282
on his violation
of the Punishment of Violences Act

267
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:59,368
in an incident
of a mass weaponized assault is ready.

268
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:01,454
I hereby announce

269
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:06,209
that the Defendant used a weapon

270
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,336
to cause fractures to the hired guards

271
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,422
in his conflict with them.

272
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:12,965
Furthermore

273
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,344
the witnesses' stories match

274
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:20,056
and the Defendant was confirmed
to have fled the site.

275
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,186
While the Defendant does not have
relevant prior convictions

276
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:27,563
the witnesses' testimonies match

277
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,607
the facts of the indictment

278
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,567
and despite many witnesses' statements

279
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,111
and evidence to prove them

280
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,445
the Defendant is presenting

281
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:37,532
excuses that are difficult to understand.

282
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,075
On top of that

283
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,494
despite there being many residents

284
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:43,454
and other witnesses on site

285
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:46,415
no evidence has been submitted

286
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:48,334
to support the Defendant's claims.

287
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,169
And despite the victim

288
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:52,255
suffering from a serious fracture

289
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:55,258
the Defendant did not make
any sincere effort

290
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:56,759
to take responsibility

291
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:59,512
or to reach a settlement.

292
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,932
Therefore, the court has reached
the following decision.

293
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,475
The court hereby orders

294
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,310
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

295
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:09,522
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

296
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,783
The Defendant has one week to appeal

297
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:23,119
to the court's decision

298
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:24,912
from the day of the announcement.

299
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,331
If an appeal is not filed

300
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:29,750
the decision will be carried out

301
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,335
as announced.

302
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:54,609
Yeah.

303
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,444
Let's get lunch together.

304
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,288
You think Mr. Eom will do as you want?

305
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,333
He will.

306
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,002
Because he's already signed

307
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:15,129
to be Haenal's legal advisor.

308
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:18,174
You already have your results
before even submitting the test?

309
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,804
Mr. Eom has no way out now.

310
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:24,889
Mr. Woo thinks

311
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,683
he just needs to get
through the confirmation hearing

312
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,686
but he'll be more humiliated
than he ever imagined.

313
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,813
So, I can stop Gyo-hun.

314
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,525
And Haenal Law Firm gets Mr. Eom.

315
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:37,652
But what about you?

316
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:41,572
I just needed something

317
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:45,493
to bring to the table
to become Mr. Yu's son-in-law, anyway.

318
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:48,454
Interesting.

319
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:52,959
You also handed the list of draft dodgers

320
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:55,378
to Yi-seok without anything in return.

321
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,048
You said it was to get revenge
on your buddy from law school

322
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:00,841
but that can't be the real reason.

323
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:08,140
Judge Lee

324
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,060
what's your real reason
behind approaching me?

325
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:18,234
I've already told you.

326
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:19,902
What do you think I'm like?

327
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:22,863
You look like someone who can lead me.

328
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,658
I only hope to serve my rightful purpose.

329
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:27,868
But what do you want from me?

330
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,330
I'll tell you another time.

331
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,168
So, you do want something?

332
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:46,262
You've lived
in a redevelopment zone, right?

333
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:47,430
Yes, sir.

334
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:49,515
Didn't that lead to any issues?

335
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:52,435
Like compensation issues for demolition.

336
00:21:53,602 --> 00:21:54,603
And maybe

337
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:56,272
such issues

338
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:58,816
led to bigger disasters of sorts.

339
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,737
Kang Sin-jin knows about what happened.

340
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:09,618
To be frank

341
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:14,332
my father had

342
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,375
an issue.

343
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:21,547
He was protesting against the demolition

344
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:23,883
and was imprisoned

345
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,885
for aggravated assault.

346
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,721
How unfortunate.

347
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,809
But that's all in the past.

348
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:39,482
MANWOL

349
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:42,318
Alright, see you around, then.

350
00:22:58,334 --> 00:22:59,585
What a ridiculous combo.

351
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:05,299
I have a bad feeling about Judge Lee.

352
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,261
Why? Because of the sinkhole case?

353
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:12,598
No, he'll be good in court.

354
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:14,350
You've seen him in the Chungnam Court.

355
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:15,601
What else, then?

356
00:23:15,684 --> 00:23:18,854
The first day
Judge Lee came to work in Seoul

357
00:23:18,938 --> 00:23:21,649
I saw him coming out of Mr. Kang's office.

358
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:23,901
And it seems

359
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:25,986
that they had lunch together today.

360
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:33,661
I'm sure he has a good reason.

361
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:44,713
Would you like me to do it?

362
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:45,798
Look here, Byeon.

363
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,010
You think I'm doing this
because I have too much free time?

364
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:53,389
With every letter I glue down

365
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:55,933
with all my might

366
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,310
it feels like I'm stuffing trash

367
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:00,729
down that bitch's throat.

368
00:24:01,397 --> 00:24:03,232
You have no idea how satisfying it is.

369
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:06,068
Why would I leave such a fun job to you?

370
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,320
But wait.

371
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:11,449
People these days
don't spell out the word "you."

372
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:12,825
Don't they just write "u"?

373
00:24:12,908 --> 00:24:15,161
Yes, that's short for "you."

374
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:17,705
Right? I knew it.

375
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,958
Nobody has time to spell everything right.

376
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:22,918
That's how it should be.

377
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:27,798
Alright, I'm all done.

378
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,717
- Glove off.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:33,387
What?

380
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:35,181
What's this?

381
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:41,854
You know Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

382
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:43,856
Leave it to her.

383
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:46,650
I know she's crazy

384
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:49,487
but a Minister of Justice candidate is...

385
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:52,114
I'll take full responsibility.

386
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:55,701
Yes, sir.

387
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,128
Can't believe
I sent my kid abroad to study

388
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:07,421
for this bullshit.

389
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,785
Honey.

390
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:38,869
Honey!

391
00:25:40,454 --> 00:25:42,122
There are suspicious cars outside.

392
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:43,415
What's going on?

393
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:50,089
Yes, Mr. Chu.

394
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:52,800
I don't think

395
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:54,885
they're coming tonight.

396
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:56,011
Is that so?

397
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:58,347
Time to cast the bait, then.

398
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:00,849
Offer double the settlement money.

399
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:03,644
If that's not enough, keep doubling it.

400
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,272
They're greedy for cash.

401
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,649
They'll come when they smell it.

402
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:10,943
Are you busy?

403
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:13,779
How many times do I have to tell you
you have to say hello first?

404
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:15,281
Let's meet.

405
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:16,907
Aren't you going to say hi?

406
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:19,702
It's about time you thank me
for helping you move to Seoul.

407
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:21,787
I'll thank you, alright?

408
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,416
Well, I can't break or manipulate the law,
so there's basically nothing I can do.

409
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,501
Let's get dinner together.

410
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:29,253
You're giving me the creeps.

411
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:31,839
Have dinner with me,
and we'll call it even.

412
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,382
Really?

413
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:35,342
You can't take it back, okay?

414
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:36,844
I won't.

415
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:38,220
But

416
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:42,600
you know that junior colleague
in the prosecution?

417
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:48,397
Come and sit.

418
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:56,322
There's no way I'm closing
CEO Jang's offshore tax evasion case.

419
00:26:58,324 --> 00:26:59,325
Do whatever you want.

420
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:00,993
Love your spirit.

421
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,334
What's this?

422
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,753
A part of the set.

423
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:12,796
Do your thing with this, too.

424
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:14,298
You're the only one

425
00:27:15,341 --> 00:27:16,342
I can trust.

426
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:27,603
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A

427
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,688
Drugs?

428
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:33,400
Damn it.

429
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:37,988
She's well-educated.

430
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:42,451
LETTER OF ADMISSION

431
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,536
Woo Hee-young?

432
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:50,668
FATHER, WOO GYO-HUN
MOTHER, HAN YEON-HWA

433
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:52,086
Woo Gyo-hun?

434
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:55,047
Woo Gyo-hun...

435
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:02,262
Woo Gyo-hun,
the Minister of Justice candidate?

436
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:08,435
Why is he handing me a ticking time bomb?

437
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,313
Damn it.

438
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:15,693
PARK CHEOL-WOO

439
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:17,903
Hey, Cheol-woo.

440
00:28:19,238 --> 00:28:20,948
Are you free after work tonight?

441
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:22,074
Tonight?

442
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:23,325
Do you have plans already?

443
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,955
No, not really.

444
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:30,332
Where should we meet?

445
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,167
About the road collapse.

446
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,169
Taemyeong Construction built it

447
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:37,798
and rumors say Mayor Chu is
the real boss there.

448
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:42,010
I expected as much
from someone of his caliber.

449
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:43,721
I guess he's a gangster, after all.

450
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,855
Are both Defendant and Plaintiff here?

451
00:28:52,938 --> 00:28:55,190
I'm Hong Sang-gi,
the Plaintiff's representative.

452
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,571
Hello, I'm Attorney Yu Ha-na
from Haenal Law Firm.

453
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,366
It's been a hot minute,
my dear sister-in-law.

454
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:12,958
Hello.

455
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:18,797
Oh.

456
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:20,424
Se-hee's blind date?

457
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:21,508
Yes.

458
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,054
A single judge in a civil division?

459
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:28,640
- Yes.
- Great, then.

460
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,227
We needed someone in the civil division.

461
00:29:33,812 --> 00:29:35,147
Going forward, run your verdicts by me

462
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,858
before finalizing them
for any cases represented by Haenal.

463
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:41,236
Sorry?

464
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,282
Why are you so surprised?

465
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,077
You don't expect me
to write the verdict, too, do you?

466
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:50,746
Oh...

467
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:52,206
You got fast-tracked to Seoul

468
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,249
as soon as you became
my family's son-in-law.

469
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,834
That wasn't for free.

470
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:59,963
At least we don't care
about your education or family.

471
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:01,840
Just as long as you're obedient.

472
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:15,979
Firstly, I'd like to express deep regret

473
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:17,940
to all the victims in the sinkhole case...

474
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:19,274
What victims?

475
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:21,777
Sorry?

476
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,781
One died

477
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,116
and some

478
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:29,993
got injured

479
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:31,745
right?

480
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,122
Are you asking me, the judge,
to answer that?

481
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,293
No, it's nothing like that.

482
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:39,670
You just caught me off-guard.

483
00:30:39,753 --> 00:30:41,046
PLAINTIFF

484
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:51,139
MEDIATION ROOM

485
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:00,023
It's me.

486
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:01,441
The court date will be scheduled soon.

487
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:04,653
This is a special request
from Assemblyman Kang of the ruling party.

488
00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:06,405
You sure you can win?

489
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,073
Don't worry.

490
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,033
I even have an insurance policy.

491
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:14,454
Mr. Heo, you said you'd work with me

492
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,874
to spread the word about this case.

493
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:20,627
You have to tell me
exactly what happened that day.

494
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,171
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:25,924 --> 00:31:28,010
- Sir.
- Honey

496
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:30,262
- they must be back again.
- Mr. Heo!

497
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:33,140
- Mr. Heo!
- I'll call the police.

498
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:35,183
- Wait, Ms. Song.
- Are you inside?

499
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:40,606
They'll definitely return.

500
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:42,816
Don't fight them. Just agree to settle.

501
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,067
I'll expose Yong-jin

502
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:46,612
and all his illegal acts in court.

503
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:49,239
I'm going to settle.

504
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:52,618
- What?
- Honey!

505
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,038
It's okay. You can open the door.

506
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:58,206
- Dong-gi.
- It's fine.

507
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,208
Let them in.

508
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,052
I don't want to be hurt anymore

509
00:32:10,218 --> 00:32:12,512
and my Min-gu will understand.

510
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,600
You might regret this later.

511
00:32:16,683 --> 00:32:18,226
I'll call the cops

512
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,603
and write all about this.

513
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:20,771
Ms. Song

514
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:25,317
thanks for everything. I mean it.

515
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,531
But please respect my decision this time.

516
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,533
Please.

517
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:35,953
Please don't say anything.

518
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:38,455
Mr. Heo...

519
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,542
My, my.

520
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:45,087
I'm tired of coming back, alright?

521
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:54,179
Count carefully.

522
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:55,931
That's 100 million right there.

523
00:32:57,474 --> 00:33:00,143
Is 100 million won enough?

524
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:02,104
From the looks of those thugs

525
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:03,730
they'd skin you from head to toe

526
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:05,273
if you don't pay them back.

527
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:08,235
Dong-gi, what is he talking about?

528
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:10,112
Mr. Heo!

529
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:11,530
It's okay.

530
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,908
You think those loansharks took him

531
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,785
on a sweet little picnic or what?

532
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:18,704
Man, you’re clueless.

533
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:24,876
All good now?

534
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:34,803
When you see them

535
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:37,097
tell them I miss them dearly.

536
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:38,807
Don't forget.

537
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:43,145
Goodbye, then.

538
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:48,900
Mr. Heo.

539
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:51,236
No, I'll report them to the police.

540
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,362
Honey!

541
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:57,868
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

542
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,580
PLAINTIFF HEO DONG-GI

543
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:06,626
Mr. Kang!

544
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,753
Yes.

545
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:11,381
I closed the last settlement deal.

546
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:13,008
Yes.

547
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:24,102
Ms. Kim?

548
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:34,029
Oh...

549
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,952
Where are you?

550
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,586
- Jin-a!
- Hey, Cheol-woo.

551
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:55,467
He's a judge I've known
since Chungcheongnam-do.

552
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,135
She's Kim Jin-a, the upright prosecutor

553
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:59,137
a junior prosecutor
at the Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

554
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,348
Hello, I'm Lee Han-young.

555
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:03,058
I'm Kim Jin-a.

556
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:05,268
What's going on?

557
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:08,313
Sorry, I double-booked myself.

558
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:13,944
I've actually come today
to discuss something with you.

559
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:16,071
- Huh?
- Let's meet another time.

560
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:18,865
I guess you can't tell him around a judge?

561
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:20,826
Sorry?

562
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:23,703
You can't say what you want
around a judge?

563
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:29,000
Isn't it a bit early to be crossing lines?

564
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:30,168
What are you doing?

565
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:32,045
- Me?
- Cheol-woo

566
00:35:32,754 --> 00:35:34,631
- see you next time.
- Okay.

567
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:37,092
I guess it's something shameful?

568
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:47,269
Hey!

569
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:49,396
We've met before.

570
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:53,942
In our previous lives?

571
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:56,570
Oh

572
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:59,114
you pretended to know me

573
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:01,616
a few mornings ago, right?

574
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,535
- Nope.
- No?

575
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:06,454
Whoever he thought I was,
he waved at me like we were old pals.

576
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:09,082
I was waving at my friend
who also moved from the Chungnam Court.

577
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,542
No, you two were so awkward.

578
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:14,171
You know what's really awkward?

579
00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:17,340
A nobody prosecutor going
after the Ministry of Justice candidate.

580
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:23,513
You double-booked yourself on purpose,
huh?

581
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:24,931
What do you think you're doing?

582
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:27,058
You just said you wanted to say hi.

583
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:28,143
Prosecutor Park!

584
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:29,311
I'm sorry.

585
00:36:30,729 --> 00:36:33,315
Prosecutor Park owes me one.

586
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,691
I see.

587
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:38,111
I'd really better get going.

588
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:40,405
Enjoy your dinner.

589
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:46,703
- What are you...
- "I love u"?

590
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,874
"I love u"!

591
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,919
I hope

592
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:56,338
my dear Prosecutor Kim Jin-a realizes

593
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:58,548
how much I love her.

594
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:05,263
Isn't this blood?

595
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,765
Wow.

596
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:09,893
He loves you so much
that he vomited blood.

597
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:15,899
Oh.

598
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:18,985
Must be from one of those guys
I locked up in jail.

599
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:20,862
It's made with love.

600
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:22,697
Not a bad souvenir.

601
00:37:23,114 --> 00:37:25,825
Looks like it's from someone
you failed to lock up in jail.

602
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:30,997
How long are you going to let CEO Jang
send these little souvenirs?

603
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:33,541
CEO Jang Tae-sik of S Shopping?

604
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,085
Bust Woo Gyo-hun's daughter.

605
00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:37,337
Then, I'll help you bust Jang Tae-sik.

606
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:40,257
Didn't know you were a pathological liar.

607
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,051
Bust Woo Hee-young and stop her daddy
from becoming the Minister.

608
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:44,594
I'm the mastermind behind it.

609
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:52,394
Didn't you want to bust Jang Tae-sik?

610
00:37:53,478 --> 00:37:56,481
Mr. Woo's confirmation hearing would be
the perfect day for it.

611
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:06,992
I'd like to pay, please.

612
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,744
Oh, Mr. Lee!

613
00:38:10,203 --> 00:38:11,204
Hey.

614
00:38:14,582 --> 00:38:15,625
I'm hungry.

615
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:25,844
Mr. Lee, are you hungry?

616
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:30,515
Your credit card, please.

617
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:38,023
Wow!

618
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:40,317
I made it for you. It looks like you.

619
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,694
Me? Is that why he's smiling?

620
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:44,738
So, Judge Lee.

621
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:46,239
What's he really like?

622
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:49,451
I don't know much, either.

623
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:53,913
But I think I know what lies in his heart.

624
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:56,875
It's not justice.

625
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,002
Instead, there's animosity.

626
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:02,672
He empathizes with the victims
a little too much.

627
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:07,594
That's dangerous.

628
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,440
This bastard!

629
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,528
This is for you. I know you're into this.

630
00:40:16,037 --> 00:40:19,082
Didn't know you were so cute, Mr. Jang.

631
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:26,881
I wanted something bolder.

632
00:40:30,802 --> 00:40:31,886
I'm disappointed.

633
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:39,936
Guess you didn't like my love letter.

634
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:44,023
Should I have gone
with something more normal?

635
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:48,069
Here.

636
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,071
Finish it.

637
00:40:52,657 --> 00:40:54,659
- Let's go, Byeon.
- Yes, sir.

638
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:17,557
So, that prosecutor bitch's dad is
in the hospital?

639
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,641
Yes, sir.

640
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:21,561
Most of her salary goes to pay
for his hospital bills

641
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:23,688
so she just lives in a shoebox apartment.

642
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:26,900
What a crazy bitch.

643
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:28,902
She thinks she can live off her wage

644
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:31,404
just by being a prosecutor?

645
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:32,822
I know, right?

646
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:35,492
What should I do?

647
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:36,826
What else?

648
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:41,331
Time to shove money down her throat
until she chokes.

649
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,417
She's just not tasted
the power of money yet.

650
00:41:47,128 --> 00:41:49,172
What a funny bitch.

651
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:55,970
Hey, why aren't they coming?

652
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,014
What if he already paid them off?

653
00:41:58,765 --> 00:42:01,059
Nobody from the family has stepped
out of the house.

654
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:06,231
Why aren't those bastards getting to work?

655
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:07,982
How do they get all their money?

656
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:13,363
Hey, are you sure you paid him right?

657
00:42:14,656 --> 00:42:15,657
Yes, sir.

658
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:28,920
A civic group should've filed a case

659
00:42:29,504 --> 00:42:31,714
regarding your stock parking by now.

660
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:35,552
What did you just say?

661
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:36,928
Who would do that?

662
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:41,432
Wait, today is Saturday.

663
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:44,227
They have until 1 p.m.

664
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:53,069
So, what do I do now?

665
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:58,533
"It's not appropriate for me
to comment on an ongoing investigation."

666
00:43:00,118 --> 00:43:01,744
Just say that.

667
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:12,255
What a pain.

668
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:20,638
Okay.

669
00:43:24,183 --> 00:43:26,227
WOO GYO-HUN REFUSES TO COMMENT
ON STOCK PARKING ALLEGATIONS

670
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:28,104
SAYING IT'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION

671
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:30,607
It already smells like a set-up.

672
00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:35,945
Alright!

673
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:38,990
It's rent collection day, so it's on me.

674
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:40,867
What, you own a whole building now?

675
00:43:42,827 --> 00:43:43,828
This is mine.

676
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,043
Huh? You actually own this building?

677
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:51,252
You didn't know?

678
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:52,378
Of course not!

679
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:57,842
You could've even paid for my car.

680
00:43:57,925 --> 00:44:00,511
I can't do that.
That'd cause you big trouble.

681
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:02,388
Isn't there a law against that?

682
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:06,392
MY SON HAS FALLEN,
AND I AM STILL STANDING THERE

683
00:44:07,977 --> 00:44:09,562
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

684
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:15,693
Hello.

685
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:16,944
Hi, Ms. Song.

686
00:44:17,445 --> 00:44:19,280
One of the victims in the sinkhole case

687
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:22,659
lost his pet dog.
Would you like to see him?

688
00:44:23,618 --> 00:44:24,952
No.

689
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:27,455
The only sinkhole victim I'm focusing on

690
00:44:27,538 --> 00:44:30,667
is the one who lost his son.

691
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,377
That's why I'm telling you to see him.

692
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,711
It'll help you.

693
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:39,050
Aren't you a team with Ms. Yu Se-hee?

694
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:41,636
Haenal wouldn't appreciate you doing this.

695
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,513
Judges don't take sides.

696
00:44:43,596 --> 00:44:44,722
I'll send you the address.

697
00:44:47,392 --> 00:44:49,352
Who is it? A woman?

698
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:50,728
No, a reporter.

699
00:44:51,062 --> 00:44:53,981
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG:
12, CHOLIM-RO, NAMMYEON DISTRICT, SEOUL

700
00:44:54,774 --> 00:44:57,068
Does he really think I'd go?

701
00:44:57,443 --> 00:44:58,945
He's not even on my side.

702
00:45:00,488 --> 00:45:02,156
Judges don't take sides.

703
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:04,409
My gosh.

704
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:09,622
You know what?

705
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:12,208
Reporters don't take sides, either.

706
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:13,918
Let's go.

707
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:24,595
Who's there?

708
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:28,850
Hello, I'm Song Na-yeon,
a reporter at Daejin Daily.

709
00:45:30,226 --> 00:45:33,479
BAMTOL

710
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:40,653
Nice to meet you.

711
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:43,322
What brings you here?

712
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:48,161
HAND-PULLED SUJEBI AND KALGUKSU

713
00:46:03,092 --> 00:46:04,927
Could you tell me

714
00:46:05,011 --> 00:46:07,180
what happened?

715
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:15,438
I spotted an odd crack in the road
the day before the accident

716
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:18,900
so I reported it to the District Office.

717
00:46:18,983 --> 00:46:20,193
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

718
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:21,402
PLAINTIFF LEE JANG-SEOK

719
00:46:26,365 --> 00:46:28,409
DEFENDANT

720
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:33,790
The Plaintiffs and the Defendant seem
to have reached an agreement.

721
00:46:34,165 --> 00:46:38,377
Yes, Your Honor.
All 12 Plaintiffs agreed on a settlement.

722
00:46:39,712 --> 00:46:40,797
Okay, then.

723
00:46:41,964 --> 00:46:43,633
I'll respect the mutual agreement

724
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:46,219
and conclude the case.

725
00:46:47,303 --> 00:46:48,387
Good work.

726
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:51,265
Your Honor!

727
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:54,477
There's proof
that the Defendant coerced a settlement.

728
00:46:56,562 --> 00:46:57,647
Wait!

729
00:46:59,565 --> 00:47:03,569
Hello, you represent Mr. Heo Dong-gi,
right?

730
00:47:04,362 --> 00:47:05,530
Yes.

731
00:47:05,613 --> 00:47:07,907
This is a video
of a Nammyeon District officer

732
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,201
coercing the victim to settle.

733
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:13,371
- Your Honor!
- Overruled.

734
00:47:14,497 --> 00:47:16,082
- What?
- Sit.

735
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:26,092
A million won is plenty
for a damn dog's death.

736
00:47:26,592 --> 00:47:28,177
What more do you want?

737
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:29,929
The sinkhole didn't kill just a dog.

738
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:32,223
It killed my family!

739
00:47:32,974 --> 00:47:34,767
You got a dog stroller, too?

740
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,019
- That's right!
- Serve the nation. Have kids instead.

741
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:38,855
You're doing a disservice to the country!

742
00:47:39,397 --> 00:47:40,523
What, you bastard?

743
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:42,149
Where did they get that?

744
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:49,448
What's that doing there?

745
00:47:49,532 --> 00:47:50,741
Turn it off right now!

746
00:47:50,825 --> 00:47:51,826
Just be quiet!

747
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:54,829
What the hell?

748
00:47:57,582 --> 00:48:00,501
Seems like there was an agreement,
but it wasn't consensual.

749
00:48:01,419 --> 00:48:03,671
Your Honor, based on the video

750
00:48:03,754 --> 00:48:06,424
we cannot deny
that there were some unfortunate acts.

751
00:48:06,507 --> 00:48:09,510
However, that's just one officer
going rogue.

752
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:10,595
You cannot assume

753
00:48:10,678 --> 00:48:12,513
all other victims were also coerced

754
00:48:12,597 --> 00:48:13,764
based on just one video.

755
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:15,391
It's not just one case.

756
00:48:15,474 --> 00:48:17,059
I've confirmed

757
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:19,312
the restaurant owner behind the complaint
was also threatened.

758
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:22,398
What did the District Office employees
come and say to you?

759
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:24,275
What else?

760
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:26,068
They didn't even come.

761
00:48:26,152 --> 00:48:28,613
What? They didn't even come?

762
00:48:28,696 --> 00:48:29,822
To assess the situation?

763
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:32,033
Not at all. No officers here.

764
00:48:33,492 --> 00:48:35,870
Not anyone who looked
even remotely connected to the District.

765
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:38,998
The office claims they checked the site
upon receiving the report

766
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:41,584
and didn't find any issues.

767
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:47,131
You haven't told this to anyone, have you?

768
00:48:47,214 --> 00:48:49,050
I tried!

769
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:53,888
I saw Mayor Chu lying bluntly on TV

770
00:48:54,513 --> 00:48:55,806
so I got mad.

771
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,143
I tried to tell the reporters
who came to see the sinkhole

772
00:48:59,226 --> 00:49:02,271
that Mayor Chu was lying

773
00:49:02,355 --> 00:49:04,607
but someone came from behind

774
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:07,568
and grabbed my shoulders.

775
00:49:08,194 --> 00:49:09,445
This guy came

776
00:49:09,987 --> 00:49:11,614
and stared right through me.

777
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:12,990
I got so scared

778
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:14,951
that I couldn't say anything.

779
00:49:16,702 --> 00:49:17,703
Is that so?

780
00:49:24,043 --> 00:49:27,088
This means we'll have to see

781
00:49:27,171 --> 00:49:30,675
if the other Plaintiffs were also coerced
into settling.

782
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:32,760
Your Honor!

783
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:33,886
Overruled.

784
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:39,350
What the officer did in the clip was

785
00:49:39,767 --> 00:49:42,103
an act of assault and coercion.

786
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,563
This constitutes a criminal offense

787
00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:46,357
and there is clear proof of it.

788
00:49:48,442 --> 00:49:50,236
Please face your criminal charges first.

789
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:53,531
A criminal trial?
What are you going to do now?

790
00:49:53,948 --> 00:49:56,367
It's on you for threatening the victims!

791
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:57,493
No, I...

792
00:49:59,203 --> 00:50:01,247
You're kidding me!

793
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:05,751
This is only the start.

794
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,878
As the trial's outcome depends

795
00:50:07,962 --> 00:50:10,089
on the outcome of the criminal case

796
00:50:10,172 --> 00:50:11,757
this civil case will be postponed

797
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:14,969
until the criminal case is concluded.

798
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:17,888
We'll soon find out

799
00:50:17,972 --> 00:50:19,640
why he had to resort to violence and rush

800
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:23,185
just to settle mere 500 million won.

801
00:50:24,603 --> 00:50:26,731
To start, go to the prosecution
for your investigation.

802
00:50:27,606 --> 00:50:28,607
That is all.

803
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:49,920
Good work.

804
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:51,547
It's nothing.

805
00:50:59,013 --> 00:51:01,849
Someone played a clip
of a district employee beating a victim.

806
00:51:01,932 --> 00:51:04,143
Judge Lee requested
the prosecution to investigate.

807
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:07,688
But the prosecutor in charge is

808
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:11,233
Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo

809
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,027
who helped Judge Lee catch
the serial killer.

810
00:51:14,111 --> 00:51:16,447
They were hired in Seoul
around the same time.

811
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:19,200
If Mayor Chu gets busted

812
00:51:19,283 --> 00:51:21,327
it'll put Assemblyman Kang at risk.

813
00:51:22,995 --> 00:51:25,331
How much money went into Kang's funds?

814
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:27,750
Around two billion won.

815
00:51:29,794 --> 00:51:31,295
Tell Assemblyman Kang

816
00:51:31,378 --> 00:51:32,922
to cut off all ties with Mayor Chu

817
00:51:33,172 --> 00:51:34,673
and to erase all traces.

818
00:51:35,508 --> 00:51:36,634
Yes, sir.

819
00:51:37,593 --> 00:51:38,594
But

820
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,348
what are you going to do with Judge Lee?

821
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:45,935
I don't believe

822
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:48,479
Judge Lee is one of us.

823
00:51:51,148 --> 00:51:52,691
You think I don't know that?

824
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:56,403
They found a video of the victims

825
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:58,531
being coerced into settlement
by the officers.

826
00:51:59,865 --> 00:52:01,534
I guess it'll be a criminal case, then.

827
00:52:01,617 --> 00:52:02,827
Yes, Mr. Baek.

828
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,203
That's enough of that.

829
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:09,375
Don't you have something to tell me?

830
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:11,210
What does he mean?

831
00:52:11,544 --> 00:52:13,087
Is he suspecting something?

832
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:18,801
I apologize
for not concluding the case myself

833
00:52:19,593 --> 00:52:21,679
when you trusted me with it.

834
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:24,807
That's okay.

835
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,059
Come anytime
if you have anything to tell me.

836
00:52:27,601 --> 00:52:29,019
Or a favor to ask me.

837
00:52:31,188 --> 00:52:33,482
CHIEF JUDGE OFFICE

838
00:52:37,444 --> 00:52:39,405
It's too early to tell him the truth.

839
00:52:47,371 --> 00:52:49,707
How did this end up playing
in the middle of the trial?

840
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:53,335
Mayor Chu is in a gang.

841
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:56,630
He must've used his guys
to coerce the victims into settling.

842
00:52:59,091 --> 00:53:01,677
All our clients are veteran criminals.

843
00:53:02,052 --> 00:53:04,221
It doesn't matter
if he's a gangster or a murderer.

844
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,098
You should've been more prepared.

845
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:07,349
Zip it.

846
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:08,684
Handle it, alright?

847
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:10,603
While minimizing the risk.

848
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:12,104
Okay.

849
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:18,027
Oh, my, what's with the glum faces?

850
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:21,197
Don't I look great?

851
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:23,324
The insurance was no help.

852
00:53:23,657 --> 00:53:24,867
Clean it and put it back.

853
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,160
Whatever.

854
00:53:26,243 --> 00:53:29,205
You know
how expensive the cancellation fee is.

855
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:32,291
Well...

856
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:36,253
Hello.

857
00:53:37,504 --> 00:53:40,382
I figured you must be quite stressed
about Mayor Chu's case.

858
00:53:41,383 --> 00:53:44,053
That's nothing to stress over.

859
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:48,265
That's Judge Lee Han-young.

860
00:53:48,933 --> 00:53:50,559
He'll be our family soon.

861
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,519
Family? Who says?

862
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:56,440
- Yu Jin-gwang.
- Lee Han-young.

863
00:53:56,523 --> 00:53:57,858
It's been a minute, Jin-gwang.

864
00:53:57,942 --> 00:53:59,944
Presiding Judge Lee Han-young.

865
00:54:00,903 --> 00:54:02,696
Here's a delivery for you.

866
00:54:03,113 --> 00:54:04,114
What is it?

867
00:54:04,615 --> 00:54:06,450
The final verdict for S Group's case.

868
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,370
You'll have to write
the final verdict of your life

869
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,288
in prison.

870
00:54:11,372 --> 00:54:12,581
What a handsome guy.

871
00:54:12,665 --> 00:54:13,749
Have a seat.

872
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:23,092
If you're so worried about us

873
00:54:23,175 --> 00:54:26,053
you shouldn't have accepted
the victim's video as proof.

874
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,975
If I dismissed the case,
even with a clip of the coercion

875
00:54:31,517 --> 00:54:32,935
the press and the Plaintiffs

876
00:54:33,018 --> 00:54:35,980
would've questioned
my ties to Haenal Law Firm.

877
00:54:37,064 --> 00:54:39,400
A judge has to be fair, indeed.

878
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:41,318
Dad!

879
00:54:43,153 --> 00:54:44,863
Mayor Chu will be exposed

880
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:46,865
for funneling illegal funds soon.

881
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,410
Are you sure?

882
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:50,661
Cutting him off will be

883
00:54:50,744 --> 00:54:53,455
the firm's best way
of minimizing the risks.

884
00:54:58,544 --> 00:55:01,839
That's unfortunate for my client.

885
00:55:02,464 --> 00:55:05,968
BEEF ENTRAILS

886
00:55:12,266 --> 00:55:15,227
I wondered why people ever chose this
over all the good food

887
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,854
but this is seriously good.

888
00:55:25,112 --> 00:55:26,113
Eat up.

889
00:55:26,196 --> 00:55:27,323
Don't worry.

890
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:30,784
Two more orders of the intestines!

891
00:55:30,868 --> 00:55:32,578
Okay, coming!

892
00:55:35,122 --> 00:55:36,123
Please!

893
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,761
Drink slowly.

894
00:55:49,511 --> 00:55:50,721
Do you come here often?

895
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:53,515
This is where Se-hee said
she'd only have one piece

896
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,893
and had three servings
in our previous lives.

897
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:57,394
Have some.

898
00:55:58,312 --> 00:56:00,439
I've been here with a colleague.

899
00:56:02,274 --> 00:56:03,275
Colleen?

900
00:56:04,735 --> 00:56:05,819
Talk about a ladies' man.

901
00:56:07,112 --> 00:56:08,906
- What's for Round Two?
- I have plans.

902
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:10,199
Don't be such a snob!

903
00:56:11,116 --> 00:56:12,618
Where are my intestines?

904
00:56:14,328 --> 00:56:15,496
Is it a girl?

905
00:56:15,579 --> 00:56:16,622
A colleague.

906
00:56:16,997 --> 00:56:18,457
Did I ask for her name?

907
00:56:18,874 --> 00:56:21,502
Why the hell do you keep mentioning
this Colleen girl?

908
00:56:21,585 --> 00:56:22,628
A colleague.

909
00:56:24,463 --> 00:56:25,631
Yeah, so...

910
00:56:27,174 --> 00:56:28,384
Someone he knows.

911
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:31,720
Someone he knows...

912
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:33,722
A colleague.

913
00:56:36,141 --> 00:56:37,267
Someone he knows...

914
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:41,730
This is embarrassing.

915
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:44,108
I feel like an idiot!

916
00:56:49,363 --> 00:56:53,659
PROSECUTION SERVICE

917
00:57:17,724 --> 00:57:19,852
Mayor Chu is backed by Assemblyman Kang.

918
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:22,896
If you aren't prepared to take both down,
don't even bother starting.

919
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:36,743
You own Taemyeong Construction, don't you?

920
00:57:40,998 --> 00:57:42,916
It's time for me to take my meds.

921
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:44,460
Go ahead.

922
00:57:48,255 --> 00:57:49,923
I don't have any health conditions.

923
00:57:50,007 --> 00:57:51,300
They're just supplements.

924
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,178
We, Koreans, can't skip any meal.

925
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:57,848
But I've skipped too many
because I was busy doing my mayor work.

926
00:57:57,931 --> 00:57:59,516
That's what the supplements are for.

927
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:02,895
Why do you think

928
00:58:03,145 --> 00:58:05,439
I've called you before Mr. Cheon Hak-su

929
00:58:06,023 --> 00:58:07,316
who actually beat up people?

930
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:10,903
I know Assemblyman Kang

931
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:13,989
scrubbed your record
as the Obok gang's boss

932
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:16,158
to get you elected.

933
00:58:23,582 --> 00:58:25,542
I didn't know
Mr. Kang ran a cleaning service.

934
00:58:25,626 --> 00:58:28,962
It was game over for you
the moment you sat down.

935
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:30,839
Choose me

936
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:32,257
before they abandon you.

937
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:34,009
Don't you want to be re-elected?

938
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:48,065
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

939
00:58:58,951 --> 00:59:00,410
Mr. Chu just left.

940
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:02,829
Mr. Kang will have a lot on his mind

941
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:05,040
once he sees Chu's easy release.

942
00:59:10,295 --> 00:59:11,421
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE

943
00:59:12,422 --> 00:59:13,549
Yes, Mr. Kang.

944
00:59:13,632 --> 00:59:15,133
Jeong-tae is already calling him.

945
00:59:16,718 --> 00:59:19,471
Seems like their trust will break
sooner than I expected.

946
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:21,223
Did he mention me?

947
00:59:21,306 --> 00:59:23,267
No, he didn't mention your name.

948
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:24,977
You sure about that?

949
00:59:25,352 --> 00:59:26,436
Of course.

950
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,646
Alright, then.

951
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,441
Don't do anything
and wait until I call you.

952
00:59:32,484 --> 00:59:33,527
Sorry?

953
00:59:37,447 --> 00:59:38,740
"Wait"?

954
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:41,159
What am I, his lapdog?

955
00:59:41,952 --> 00:59:43,203
Gosh.

956
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:59,386
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

957
00:59:59,678 --> 01:00:06,727
SEONHWAGAK

958
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:17,863
Mayor Chu should be fine.

959
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:21,617
Jeong-tae

960
01:00:22,117 --> 01:00:25,370
make sure Yong-jin is the only one
getting prosecuted here.

961
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:27,122
Yes, sir.

962
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:28,874
If this affects you, too

963
01:00:28,957 --> 01:00:31,793
it'll affect your support base
in the next election.

964
01:00:33,003 --> 01:00:34,087
Sin-jin

965
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:35,922
Chu's trial shouldn't affect us, right?

966
01:00:36,006 --> 01:00:38,717
I hear he was in a gang.

967
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,885
Is that true?

968
01:00:42,846 --> 01:00:45,098
Yes, but not anymore.

969
01:00:45,182 --> 01:00:48,018
He's now just an earnest mayor
who works for the district.

970
01:00:52,064 --> 01:00:53,857
Why is he the boss
of Taemyeong Construction

971
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,942
that's full of gangsters, then?

972
01:00:57,861 --> 01:00:59,529
Oh, man.

973
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:05,369
Even the tail can wag the dog
when it’s desperate.

974
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:08,121
You mean...

975
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:29,601
You have to cut it off before it wags you.

976
01:01:45,575 --> 01:01:46,660
Yes, Mr. Kang.

977
01:01:47,494 --> 01:01:49,788
Just consider it a holiday

978
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:51,373
until things calm down.

979
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:52,833
Yes, sir.

980
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:55,377
I got it. Okay.

981
01:02:00,841 --> 01:02:02,300
- It's all good.
- Okay.

982
01:02:02,843 --> 01:02:04,678
- Everything's ready?
- Yes.

983
01:02:04,761 --> 01:02:06,054
But

984
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,181
what if we're stuck there forever?

985
01:02:08,682 --> 01:02:09,766
You're funny.

986
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:13,228
Gosh.

987
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:19,317
This is a ledger of all the kickbacks
I've paid Jeong-tae.

988
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:20,694
What's he going to do?

989
01:02:20,777 --> 01:02:23,321
He'd better treat me well

990
01:02:23,405 --> 01:02:27,284
if he wants to stay out of jail
and keep his seat in the government.

991
01:02:30,412 --> 01:02:32,789
Hak-su, when's the ferry leaving again?

992
01:02:32,873 --> 01:02:34,750
It departs at 3 a.m.

993
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:35,917
Okay.

994
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:38,253
I can't be a Mayor again

995
01:02:38,336 --> 01:02:40,797
so I might as well stick to being
Jeong-tae's upper hand.

996
01:02:41,506 --> 01:02:43,383
You know how much I've been through

997
01:02:43,467 --> 01:02:44,843
to save him from trouble.

998
01:02:45,635 --> 01:02:46,970
You're right, boss.

999
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:48,346
Hey, Han-young.

1000
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:50,932
Yong-jin is taking a ferry
in Incheon tonight.

1001
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:53,477
I'll send you the meeting location.

1002
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,561
LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE

1003
01:02:54,644 --> 01:02:56,104
I'll get on my way now

1004
01:02:56,188 --> 01:02:58,398
so don't approach him first, okay?

1005
01:03:27,344 --> 01:03:31,765
LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE
WE BUY AND SELL USED BOOKS

1006
01:03:44,778 --> 01:03:46,196
Gross.

1007
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:49,324
The dust in this place will kill me
before I even get on the ferry.

1008
01:03:49,991 --> 01:03:52,369
Just wait a sec.

1009
01:03:52,953 --> 01:03:55,330
- Why?
- I know you get seasick.

1010
01:03:57,207 --> 01:03:58,333
Good boy.

1011
01:03:58,917 --> 01:03:59,918
You can go.

1012
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:07,342
Gosh.

1013
01:04:41,793 --> 01:04:45,338
LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE
WE BUY AND SELL USED BOOKS

1014
01:04:53,555 --> 01:04:54,598
I knew it.

1015
01:05:14,284 --> 01:05:17,829
THE JUDGE RETURNS

1016
01:05:42,187 --> 01:05:43,521
How much do you trust me?

1017
01:05:43,688 --> 01:05:46,107
Kang Sin-jin, the Senior Presiding Judge.
He has a bad reputation.

1018
01:05:46,191 --> 01:05:47,233
You know Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo, right?

1019
01:05:47,317 --> 01:05:49,277
Fieldwork is for prosecutors,
not for judges.

1020
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:51,571
Hurry, Prosecutor Kim.

1021
01:05:51,738 --> 01:05:54,658
You'll need to fight for your life
if you choose to start.

1022
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:57,243
Seems like you've already put your life
on the line.

1023
01:05:59,454 --> 01:06:01,581
I told you I was the mastermind behind it.

1024
01:06:01,831 --> 01:06:04,209
Judge Lee isn't one of us yet.

1025
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:05,627
I really wonder

1026
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,462
why you approached me.

1027
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:09,756
How much do you trust me?

1028
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:14,970
