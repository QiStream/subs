00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,880
Three, four.

164
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,225
One, two three, four,
[Tulip, First year]

165
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,716
five, six, seven, eight.

166
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:46,380
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

167
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Phi,

168
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,145
I asked you to run any clip
by me before posting.

169
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:06,200
Hey, that's Tulip!

170
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,336
Tulip!

171
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,048
Tulip!

172
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,672
Tulip, come join cheer practice!

173
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,586
What's going on?

174
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:37,768
Nothing. We probably misunderstood.

175
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:40,112
Sorry, Baikhaw.

176
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,032
It's okay.

177
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,868
I just saw her a second ago. Where did she go?

178
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,428
Thanks for letting me hide.

179
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,820
What did you do? Why were they looking for you?

180
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,984
I just didn't want to do cheer practice.

181
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,900
If you didn't want to,
why not just tell them straight up?

182
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm too lazy to explain.

183
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,520
Anyway, thanks for earlier and for the quiz too.

184
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,540
Hey, Baikhaw, are you free right now?

185
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,348
Why?

186
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,244
Do you want to eat something?

187
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,864
Hey! Tulip, there you are.

188
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:51,004
I texted you a ton. Why didn't you reply?

189
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:54,772
I was hiding from the cheer seniors. Sorry.

190
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,828
Oh... this is Baikhaw, my classmate.

191
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:03,852
And this is Wawwa, my high school friend.

192
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,272
She's studying communication arts.

193
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,400
I see.

194
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,120
Hello.

195
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,550
Let's go eat somewhere nearby.

196
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,560
Come with us, Baikhaw.

197
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,584
I'm not really hungry. You guys go ahead.

198
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,500
"Baikhaw"?

199
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,810
That name sounds familiar.

200
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,808
Is she kind of stuck-up or something?

201
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:31,388
No. She's just an introvert, I think.

202
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:37,728
Anyway, my seniors are throwing
a freshman party tonight.

203
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:42,080
Come with me. It's just at the pub
in front of the uni. Please...

204
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,368
I think I'll pass tonight.
I want to go back and study.

205
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:50,520
I know you'll get super busy
with studies after this

206
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,550
and won't have time to hang out with me anymore.

207
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,500
So come with me tonight, please.

208
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,370
All right, fine.

209
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,148
- Don't even.
- You're the best!

210
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,560
Hey.

211
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Come on, let me introduce you.

212
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,600
This is P'Q, my senior.

213
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,540
And this is Tulip, my best friend.

214
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,420
Hey.

215
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,050
How many drinks have you had?

216
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,440
Are you already drunk?

217
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,148
Quite a few.

218
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,496
In that case...

219
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,768
I'm fine.

220
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,290
Where's Wawwa?

221
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,080
I have no idea.

222
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,620
Maybe she's in the bathroom.

223
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,212
I'll go to the bathroom.

224
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:19,916
- I'll be right back.
- I'll take you.

225
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,170
No, it's okay.

226
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,220
Hey, Tulip. Are you okay? Can you walk?

227
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,540
She's fine.

228
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,230
I was about to take her to the restroom.

229
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,280
She's my friend. I'll take her myself.

230
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,816
It's fine. I can take her.

231
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:36,050
He's my friend. Excuse us, please.

232
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,056
You're super drunk.

233
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:42,930
Maybe you should go home. I'll take you.

234
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,860
Take me to find my friend first.

235
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,656
She's probably in the bathroom.

236
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:49,436
Okay.

237
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,736
Easy.

238
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,232
Wawwa!

239
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,496
Tulip, are you sure your friend's still here?

240
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,360
I think we should just get you home first.

241
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,590
I don't want to leave her alone.

242
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,720
Let me ask one of the staff.

243
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,088
Wait here, okay?

244
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,728
Okay.

245
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,568
Tulip! Tulip!

246
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,688
Tulip?

247
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,300
Tao, I still can't find Wawwa.

248
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,656
Are we leaving already?

249
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,224
I think... Wawwa probably went home already.

250
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,800
P'Q!

251
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,470
What about my friend Tao, Phi?

252
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,052
I have no idea.

253
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,404
Is he somewhere over there?

254
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,590
Tulip, you blush so easily.

255
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,360
What are you doing?

256
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,024
Are you feeling hot?

257
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,404
You look like you are.

258
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:01,160
Let me help.

259
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Hey, Phi!

260
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,840
- Phi, Phi. I... I'm getting out.
- Hey!

261
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,160
- Where are you going? Don't leave just yet.
- Phi!

262
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,160
- P'Q! P'Q!
- Come on.

263
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,680
Hey, Phi! Move your car!

264
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,326
- Phi!
- Back up, man!

265
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,080
Hey!

266
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,316
Dude, move your damn car!
You're blocking everyone.

267
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,584
- Who the hell am I blocking?
- Whatever, you ass!

268
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:35,060
Go jerk off at home, freak!

269
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,600
You piece of crap!

270
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,992
Hey, get up, come on! Get up.

271
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,808
Are you okay? Here, drink some water.

272
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:53,400
- You'll sober up faster.
- Thanks so much.

273
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,072
So, do you work here?

274
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:03,990
Yes, part-time.

275
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,376
I'm saving for rent and tuition.

276
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,100
Who'd you come with, anyway?

277
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,288
With Wawwa.

278
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:16,352
I have no idea where she went.

279
00:21:16,352 --> 00:21:19,250
Seriously, thanks for earlier.

280
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,464
No problem.

281
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,868
I'm just glad you're okay.

282
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,588
How are you getting home?
Do you want me to take you?

283
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:34,324
No, I'm good.

284
00:21:34,324 --> 00:21:36,640
Tulip, there you are.

285
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,120
- I've been looking for you.
- Tao.

286
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,370
Where did you go?
I almost got into trouble earlier.

287
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,236
Luckily, Baikhaw helped me out.

288
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,696
Thanks a lot.

289
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,210
- Do you two know each other?
- Yes.

290
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,316
- Okay, then she's in your hands.
- I got it.

291
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:53,510
I'm heading back to work. Bye.

292
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,176
- Damn.
- Are you all right?

293
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,220
Do you know Baikhaw, too?

294
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,620
Yes, we went to the same high school.

295
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,780
What is she like?

296
00:22:11,552 --> 00:22:15,930
She seems... unapologetically herself.

297
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,584
Yes, that's just how she is.

298
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:20,060
She keeps to herself
and doesn't really hang out with anyone.

299
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,468
She lives with her mom.

300
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:25,088
She has to work while studying
because her mom is sick.

301
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,590
She seems like a decent person.

302
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,828
She's helped me more than once already.

303
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:36,044
Yes. She is.

304
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,890
Come on, I'll walk with you.

305
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,792
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, I'll be fine.

306
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,784
Tulip, I'm sorry.
[Q]

307
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:56,860
I was really drunk.

308
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,700
[Current Balance: ฿3,500 ($110)]

309
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,592
- Hey, Jan.
- Yes, what's up, Tulip?

310
00:23:08,592 --> 00:23:11,576
We're heading to cheer practice now.

311
00:23:11,576 --> 00:23:14,130
You're still on the cheer team, right?

312
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,780
I haven't really had time.

313
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,930
Anyway, it's almost the end of the month.

314
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,636
Yes?

315
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,390
I'm running out of money.

316
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,390
When are you going to repay me
for the food the other day?

317
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,756
Sorry, I don't have any right now either.

318
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:35,670
Same here. May I repay you next month?

319
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,160
Oh, come on.

320
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,520
I don't even know if I can survive this month.

321
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,908
How much do you have on you right now?

322
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:43,540
Just pay me half first, okay?

323
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,840
No means no. I don't have it.

324
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,590
Where do you expect us to get the money?

325
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,520
Yes, seriously. Why don't you just call your dad?

326
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,732
- He's rich, isn't he?
- Right.

327
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:55,380
How does this involve
whether my father is rich or not?

328
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,960
You borrowed my money, so you should pay it back.

329
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,476
Are you saying I will stick you with the bill?

330
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:02,820
Your bag costs a hundred thousand, right?

331
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,930
Did your parents teach you
to be a beggar or something?

332
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,050
- Ee* Baikhaw! (*Rude address used only among friends)
- What?

333
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,868
Admit you're poor.

334
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:16,110
Stop pretending to be rich
while mooching off your friends.

335
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,148
- You bitch, Ee Baikhaw!
- What?

336
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:21,140
- What?
- Who do you think you're talking to?

337
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,536
- Jan!
- You bitch!

338
00:24:22,536 --> 00:24:23,856
You asshole!

339
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:25,777
Baikhaw, don't you think that was a bit harsh?

340
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:27,879
"Harsh"? She started this shit!
Didn't you hear her?

341
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,632
That's still too harsh.

342
00:24:29,632 --> 00:24:33,024
- Apologize to your friends right now.
- Why should she apologize, Phi?

343
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,350
I think Baikhaw told the truth.

344
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,064
Why is taking advantage of others
considered normal here?

345
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:41,808
We're all cheerleaders here, Tulip.

346
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:43,900
What's the point of fighting?

347
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,008
It's better to stay friends.
If you can let this slide...

348
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:48,790
It's okay.

349
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,728
If this is what friendship is like,

350
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:52,590
I'd rather have none.

351
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,960
I quit the cheer team.

352
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,056
I'm done.

353
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,844
I'll ask for my money again tomorrow.

354
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,192
I'll keep asking until you repay me.

355
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,790
Damn, you roasted them hard.

356
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,280
I bet they'll transfer the money tomorrow.

357
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,316
If they don't, I'll just roast them again.

358
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:29,610
Those shameless brats.

359
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,424
That's true.

360
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,204
Can I get your Line ID?

361
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,324
In case I need to call you.

362
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,528
Is that okay?

363
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,852
I have no one else to hang out with.

364
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,220
Yes, sure.

365
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,420
But don't call me to clean up your puke again.

366
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,370
That was disgusting.

367
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,140
Yes, once was enough.

368
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,150
[Tulip]

369
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,656
Here.

370
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,528
What's that profile pic you're using anyway?

371
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:28,460
Tulip.

372
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,640
Do you want to sit here? The seat is empty.

373
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,704
We've got lab together this evening, right?

374
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:43,240
Yes, I came to study a bit more.

375
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,030
Mind if I join you?

376
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,820
- May I take a look, too?
- Sure, but my handwriting's messy.

377
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,172
Oh, mine's way worse.

378
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:53,860
- Really?
- This part's wrong, isn't it?

379
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,504
Here, let me fix it for you.

380
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,060
It's this one.

381
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,616
There. That's how it should be.

382
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:19,644
Namo.

383
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,752
How come you're not studying with us?

384
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,190
I was going to study back at the dorm.

385
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,356
I can't focus here.

386
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,210
Okay, then...

387
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,288
Sorry, am I distracting you?

388
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,212
Never mind.

389
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,810
- Oh, Mr. Danai.
- Yes, Darling.

390
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,430
Just a second.

391
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,520
- Dad!
- Oh!

392
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,640
Hey!

393
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,620
Tulip.

394
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,352
Tulip, wait, Dear!

395
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,752
Tulip, hold on!

396
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,450
What the hell were you doing, Dad?

397
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,440
That's Mom's secretary!

398
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,928
Tulip, I'm sorry.

399
00:28:59,928 --> 00:29:01,880
I didn't know you'd be home today.

400
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,096
The reason I left this house
was because you can't keep it in your pants!

401
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:08,116
- Tulip.
- Do you know what you are?

402
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:11,300
- A cheater!
- Your mother and I...

403
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,840
We haven't loved each other in years.

404
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,280
What are you saying?

405
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,030
The only reason we've stayed
in the same house is because of you!

406
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,284
If you weren't my burden, I'd have left long ago!

407
00:29:27,284 --> 00:29:29,300
Fine then.

408
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,070
Do whatever you want.

409
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,836
I won't be your burden anymore.

410
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:37,000
Whomever you want to screw, that's on you!

411
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,544
Tulip!

412
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,920
Hey! Shit!

413
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,088
What the hell is wrong with you?

414
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,796
Why'd you slap me?

415
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,440
I-I thought you were going to...

416
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,520
Geez, weren't you about to...

417
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,780
jump off?

418
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,220
Are you insane?

419
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,744
I wasn't trying to kill myself!

420
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,300
I just had some stuff on my mind,

421
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,768
so I came up here to enjoy the view.

422
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,152
Next time you're stressed, go get drunk somewhere.

423
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:27,460
Don't come here making a scene.

424
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,644
That's none of your business.

425
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:34,200
Shit, that slap really hurt.

426
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,912
You hit me first, okay?

427
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,412
Deep down, I already knew
they didn't love each other anymore.

428
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,088
But I still can't make peace with it.

429
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,630
Why did I have to see something like that?

430
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,248
Don't listen to him too much.

431
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,788
He's just...

432
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,444
trying to dump all the blame on you.

433
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,340
He said I'm a burden.

434
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,640
How could he say something like that?

435
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,952
How many times can he let me down?

436
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,540
He doesn't get it.

437
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,340
Some people...

438
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,420
never get it even till the day they die.

439
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,260
But it's okay, really,

440
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,644
if you can't forgive him.

441
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,230
That's completely normal.

442
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,560
Girl... But he's my dad.

443
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,992
Yes, but if you forgive him now,
he'll just hurt you again.

444
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,852
Aren't you tired of that?

445
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,480
It's okay.

446
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,088
It's okay.

447
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,168
I'm really sorry. I was too drunk that night.

448
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:12,580
I was the one who was drunk, Phi.

449
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,424
If my friend hadn't shown up,

450
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:16,896
I don't want to think about
what you would've done to me.

451
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,090
I'm truly sorry.

452
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,920
Please give me another chance.

453
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,420
I promise.

454
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,372
I'll never act like that again.

455
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,200
I'll treat you with more respect from now on.

456
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,068
And how am I supposed to believe that?

457
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:36,248
You couldn't even control yourself
the first time we met.

458
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,780
How about this?

459
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,576
I'll take you out to eat to make up for it.

460
00:33:42,576 --> 00:33:44,820
No drinking, no getting drunk.

461
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,340
And I won't touch you unless you let me.

462
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,024
Deal?

463
00:33:53,312 --> 00:33:55,404
I just want to prove to you...

464
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,232
that I really like you.

465
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,668
Hey, what's up?

466
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:03,410
The doctor just called.
He said my mom's not doing well.

467
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,772
Is it serious?

468
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:07,968
I don't know, but I need to go see her now.

469
00:34:07,968 --> 00:34:10,836
- Go, of course.
- But I haven't finished Professor Ice's lab yet.

470
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:13,564
- Oh, right.
- I'm screwed.

471
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:16,380
Do you think I can ask for an extension?

472
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,690
I doubt the professor would allow that.

473
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,616
What should I do?

474
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,304
Here's what we'll do.

475
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:26,070
You go see your mom today.

476
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,400
I'll finish the lab for you.

477
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,884
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can. Don't worry.

478
00:34:31,884 --> 00:34:33,840
I'll do it.

479
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,316
Go.

480
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,036
Just go.

481
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,860
I have to go now, Phi.

482
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,672
I must hurry. Come on. Let's go.

483
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,548
Haven't you finished yet?

484
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,396
Namo.

485
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,600
I thought you finished this yesterday.

486
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,124
The one from yesterday got messed up.

487
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:34,168
So I had to redo it.

488
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,960
So are you here alone?

489
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,180
Why didn't you ask someone to keep you company?

490
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,080
It's fine. I can manage on my own.

491
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,570
What are you doing?

492
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,116
I'm helping you so it'll get done faster.

493
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,764
Here we are.

494
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,360
It's a nice place, not far from campus at all.

495
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,180
Yes. Where do you live, Namo?

496
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,520
I'm in the uni dorms.

497
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,636
Oh, right, I remember now.

498
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,320
So that means...

499
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,288
you walked all the way here just to walk me home?

500
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,290
Yes. I just didn't want you to walk alone.

501
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,500
Wow. That's really sweet of you.

502
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,110
Thanks.

503
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:52,830
If you liked girls, I'd probably fall for you.

504
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,120
What's that supposed to mean?

505
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,604
Well...

506
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,968
Oh, don't you like Tao?

507
00:37:02,968 --> 00:37:04,580
What?

508
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,210
Are you crazy?

509
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,280
It's not like that!

510
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,620
Oh...

511
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,272
Sorry, I must've misunderstood.

512
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,440
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine, it's fine.

513
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,908
Well then... I'm going back.

514
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:20,820
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, see you.

515
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,892
- Bye.
- Bye.

516
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,708
I finished your lab for you.

517
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,800
How's your mom?

518
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,030
She's feeling better.

519
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,276
Thanks so much.

520
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,768
I thought you didn't like me.

521
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,616
Where are you going?

522
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,272
Do you like the outdoors?

523
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:15,580
Leave my friend alone.

524
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,970
Oh, hey!

525
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,456
Hey!

526
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,410
What the hell is your problem? Hey!

527
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:26,856
Ee Baikhaw!

528
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:29,076
What the hell are you doing?

529
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,780
- Look at this.
- Damn.

530
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,800
What the hell is this?

531
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,350
Right.

532
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,820
- Him again? Seriously?
- Yes.

533
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,388
That scumbag has been sleeping around.

534
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,688
What's going on, guys?

535
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,276
Look at this.

536
00:38:59,392 --> 00:39:02,190
That guy is such a player.

537
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,520
Is he still hitting on you?

538
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,340
Sometimes, but I think
he's like that only when he's drunk.

539
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,532
Oh, come on. It's in his nature.

540
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:14,112
Right.

541
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,068
He does this all the time.

542
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,390
Why are you both looking at me like that?

543
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,560
I'm fine.

544
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,720
Are you sure?

545
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,140
Yes, really.

546
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,820
It's not like I like him or anything.

547
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,900
You can tell he's a total flirt.

548
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,700
If you don't like flirty guys,

549
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,350
you can like me instead.

550
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,248
I don't like flirty guys.

551
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:44,004
And I don't like narcissists either.

552
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:47,696
That's so harsh. Well then.

553
00:39:47,696 --> 00:39:50,332
Can this narcissist here
at least carry your bag for you?

554
00:39:50,332 --> 00:39:52,156
No, don't bother.

555
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:56,370
Anyway, have you guys seen Baikhaw?

556
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,808
- Have you seen her?
- No.

557
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,270
What would you like to order?

558
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,832
You never told me you work here.

559
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,012
What would you like to order?

560
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:30,552
Baikhaw, Baikhaw, the manager wants to see you.

561
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,332
What would you like to order?

562
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,416
How did you manage the counter
and let all that money disappear, Baikhaw?

563
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,120
We have only a few staff.

564
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,980
If it wasn't you, then who?

565
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,440
You're the one who's always broke
and taking cash advances.

566
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,500
You're the obvious suspect.

567
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,984
I don't know, Phi.

568
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,908
But I didn't take it.
What else do you want me to say?

569
00:40:56,908 --> 00:40:58,708
Then tell me where the money went.

570
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,180
I don't know!

571
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,948
Don't act all innocent like when you scam men.

572
00:41:03,948 --> 00:41:06,632
I'm not stupid enough to believe you.

573
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,980
Girls like you... I've seen plenty of your kind

574
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,210
with no upbringing, always lying,

575
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,080
always playing the sad, pitiful act.

576
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,536
Do you think I don't know?

577
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:23,268
People like you have only two ways to make money.

578
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:27,830
If you're not stealing,
then you're selling yourself.

579
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,752
I didn't take it.

580
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,670
You can keep lying all you want.
I can't believe it.

581
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,468
I just want my damn money back!

582
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:36,992
I said I don't know!

583
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:40,250
Fine. I'll make you talk.

584
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,620
Here.

585
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,104
Are you going to talk now? Aren't you?

586
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:52,936
- How do you like boiling water?
- What are you doing?

587
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,260
Oh...

588
00:41:57,844 --> 00:42:00,610
Hey, look...

589
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,190
I think there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

590
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,024
See, money went missing from my shop.

591
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,364
I was just questioning my staff about it.

592
00:42:08,364 --> 00:42:10,284
Maybe the method got a little out of hand.

593
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:12,000
From the way you yelled just now,

594
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,668
"a little" is an understatement.

595
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:15,820
And you were about to assault her on top of that.

596
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,304
I was just threatening her.

597
00:42:17,304 --> 00:42:19,560
Come on, let's go.

598
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,976
We're going to the police.

599
00:42:20,976 --> 00:42:23,524
Wait, wait, wait!

600
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,260
Okay, fine. I'll give you money.

601
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,290
How much do you want to delete the clip?

602
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,770
Don't you dare give in to him.

603
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,044
Guys like him belong behind bars.

604
00:42:34,044 --> 00:42:35,632
Okay, okay, okay... listen!

605
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:38,688
Forget about the missing money. I'll drop it.

606
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:40,456
I'll even give you extra cash, okay?

607
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:42,068
Just delete the clip. Please.

608
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:44,800
Please. Please.

609
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,752
Bow at my feet.

610
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,112
- What?
- Bow at my feet!

611
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,744
I'll tell my friend to delete the clip right away.

612
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:53,510
Honestly, if I had to keep working there, I could.

613
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,240
I've been treated like crap my whole life anyway.

614
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,808
I'm used to being looked down on and insulted.

615
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,828
Then why not find another job,

616
00:44:04,828 --> 00:44:07,400
one that's better than that?

617
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,212
Jobs aren't easy to find these days.

618
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,560
Do you know your life is heartbreaking?

619
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,920
I thought I had it bad, but after hearing about yours,

620
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,440
I have to admit it.

621
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,000
It's normal.

622
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,412
We all have our share of crap to deal with.

623
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,800
But thank you for today, really.

624
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,468
No one's ever stood up for me like that before.

625
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:43,320
Well, no one's ever slapped me
across the face before either.

626
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,748
Girl, sorry about that.

627
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,720
It's fine. I'm not angry.

628
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,656
When I'm with you, it kind of feels like

629
00:44:55,656 --> 00:44:58,360
we're sisters or something.

630
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,224
"Sisters"?

631
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,720
How about this?

632
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,360
Why don't you move in with me?

633
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,120
Stay here.

634
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,532
Are you crazy? No way.

635
00:45:16,532 --> 00:45:18,020
Why not?

636
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,960
It's fine. This is my place.

637
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,960
Are you out of your mind?

638
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,712
Come on, I'm serious.

639
00:45:26,712 --> 00:45:28,976
Then you won't have to work
that awful job anymore.

640
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,708
And you can help me study.

641
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,420
- Win-win!
- Hold on.

642
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,619
Are you befriending me for benefits right now?

643
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:37,955
Well, are you in or not?

644
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,830
Why are you playing hard to get?

645
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,408
This apartment is big anyway. Just stay here.

646
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,148
Good. Then I won't feel lonely.

647
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,440
[Dad]

648
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:57,840
Tulip, I'm sorry, Sweetheart.

649
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,020
Tulip. Tulip.

650
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:17,360
[I don't want to talk to you anymore.]

651
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,680
[Stay out of my life,
or I'll expose everything you've done.]

652

This is Baikhaw, my friend.

660
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,970
You just met Baikhaw.

661
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:47,150
How do you know you can trust her?

662
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:52,350
I don't really know how trustworthy Wawwa is.

663
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,920
Honestly, I feel she's not a very good friend.

♫ It's time to accept it ♫

666
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,840
♫ And walk away from the same old story ♫

667
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:16,230
♫ That someone made you
feel hurt and disappointed ♫

668
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:20,250
♫ I still remember the day
I foolishly trusted you ♫

669
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,250
♫ And in the end,
tears kept flowing again and again ♫

670
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,640
♫ I once gave my everything ♫

671
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,570
♫ But today will not be the same ♫

672
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:34,820
♫ Because being sad doesn't help anything ♫

673
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,790
♫ It's better to just let it go ♫

674
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:42,740
♫ I won't let anyone hurt me again ♫

675
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,410
♫ This has to end now ♫

676
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:49,480
♫ No matter how much I'm hurt,
it remains unchanged ♫

677
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,240
♫ Because today I... ♫

678
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,360
♫ Will keep my heart to myself ♫

679
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:02,620
♫ And won't lose it to anyone again ♫
