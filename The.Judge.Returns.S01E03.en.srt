1
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,908
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,920
Ju-yeong, repeat it out loud after me.

3
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:50,674
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin...

4
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:55,763
"The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin..."

5
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:57,848
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

6
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:01,101
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

7
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:02,269
Say it louder!

8
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:03,520
Even louder!

9
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:06,523
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

10
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:07,691
Even louder!

11
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:11,278
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin

12
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:13,113
To death!

13
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:16,450
To death!

14
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:22,289
So ordered!

15
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:54,738
Mr. Lee?

16
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,585
Wow.

17
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:10,504
I'm so glad

18
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:12,089
you're alive.

19
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:16,093
Your hell begins now.

20
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:39,032
EPISODE 3

21
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:53,463
You hit him on purpose, didn't you?

22
00:02:53,922 --> 00:02:55,174
I don't think so.

23
00:02:55,757 --> 00:02:57,009
I tried to slam on the brakes.

24
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:02,181
I heard you sentencing him to death.

25
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,351
A judge shouldn't do this.

26
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:08,270
Do I have to be nice, too?

27
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:10,439
Do prosecutors have to be nice?

28
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,373
How did you know
that Kim Sang-jin was a serial killer?

29
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,209
Criminals can't hide who they are.

30
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:35,797
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

31
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,931
You want to be a prosecutor?

32
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,474
I've been a judge for years.

33
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:46,934
Why would I quit now?

34
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:49,228
Your robe is still basically brand new.

35
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,063
It's too early for you to talk like that.

36
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:56,526
What I mean is, I haven't been
a judge for long enough

37
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:58,153
to consider a career change.

38
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:01,114
I'm going to stay under your supervision

39
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,491
and be a judge forever.

40
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:03,659
Who says?

41
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:05,744
Hey

42
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:09,248
how did you know Kim Sang-jin was

43
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:10,582
a serial killer?

44
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:13,252
It's all thanks
to your wonderful teaching.

45
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:14,711
My parents gave birth to me

46
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:17,965
but you raised me, sir.

47
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,049
What?

48
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,468
Do you take classes for that?

49
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,928
I just do as I'm taught.

50
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:25,305
Fine, don't tell me.

51
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,435
I have good and bad news.

52
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,603
I'll share the bad first.

53
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,105
- Why?
- Because I want to.

54
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,149
You may have arrested the murderer

55
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,694
but you know
you can't take his case, right?

56
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:40,904
A newbie judge like myself can only take

57
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:42,239
petty crime cases.

58
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:43,615
Serial killer cases are

59
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,409
for presiding judges and above.

60
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:48,745
The Chief Judge knows about the case

61
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,913
and is very pleased.

62
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:53,625
What?

63
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,252
And the good news?

64
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:58,338
I told you. The Chief Judge
is pleased with your work.

65
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,840
That's all you need.

66
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:02,884
BAEK YI-SEOK, CHIEF JUDGE
AT CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

67
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:05,095
Corporations struggle most
with labor unions.

68
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:07,180
For mere paid employees

69
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,890
they sure go on strikes a lot.

70
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:10,684
It's not only bad for corporates.

71
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:12,853
Isn't it also a huge loss for the nation?

72
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:14,187
Don't you agree?

73
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:17,858
Here's my take.

74
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,569
Violent and illegal strikes are

75
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,446
absolutely unacceptable.

76
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:26,450
We should charge these strikers
billions of won for damage

77
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,952
and ruin all their families.

78
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:32,164
So, what's your point?

79
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:33,874
Oh, that being said

80
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:36,418
I think the case

81
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,962
of the illegal strike
by the PK Steel Labor Union

82
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,922
under the Chungnam District Court

83
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:44,134
deserves the harsh punishment
the prosecution requests.

84
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:46,303
So, you've already gone
to the prosecution.

85
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:49,806
Of course, we must follow the procedure
with public service work.

86
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:52,309
I guess

87
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:57,898
PK Steel fed you some poison before that.

88
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,859
What? Poison?

89
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:04,071
I let you in
because you were an assemblyman

90
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,449
and here you are,
trying to bribe the Chief Judge.

91
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,161
Those in robes must protect

92
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,747
the law and conscience, not corporations.

93
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:17,584
I can see why you got
on the bad side of the higher-ups

94
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,044
and ended up here.

95
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:21,630
You should learn to protect yourself

96
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:23,507
before the invisible law and conscience.

97
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,674
Oh, and get a grip, too.

98
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:27,052
You're one to talk, Mr. Kim!

99
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,553
Look here, Chief Judge.

100
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,347
I'm just telling you

101
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,556
because it seems to me

102
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,101
that we'll meet again in court soon
for your bribery case.

103
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:35,268
What did you just say?

104
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:36,478
Get out.

105
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,732
When you're in court

106
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,069
I'll be sure to sentence you much harsher
than the prosecutors.

107
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,738
Go ahead.

108
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:49,032
I thought you'd understand.

109
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:50,909
Gosh.

110
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:05,382
Come right in.

111
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,188
Was he trying to bribe you?

112
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,023
Don't mind him.

113
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:24,443
The world is full of jerks and garbage.

114
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:27,320
Which is why

115
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:30,073
I'm even happier
when I see a good junior colleague.

116
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:31,616
Good work.

117
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:32,826
Thank you, sir.

118
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,746
You deserve a present

119
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,999
for successfully tackling a big case.

120
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:40,584
Do you want anything?

121
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,419
This is an opportunity

122
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:44,546
from Chief Judge Baek,
the Titan of the Judiciary.

123
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,673
I must seize the opportunity
while it's here.

124
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,842
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG BECOMES
THE SYMBOL OF JUSTICE

125
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:52,220
JUDGE LEE'S PERSISTENT INVESTIGATION
UNCOVERS A MURDER CASE

126
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,805
IS JUDGE LEE MORE THAN JUST HARSH WORDS?

127
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,392
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG ARRESTS
A SERIAL KILLER

128
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,771
What an interesting guy.

129
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,109
But not good enough.

130
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:10,530
He just started as a sole judge.

131
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:13,200
And he hasn't joined Baek's side yet.

132
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,035
That's not what I mean.

133
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,455
What would he have done
if he took this case as a judge?

134
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:21,208
I'd like to continue

135
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:23,710
taking Kim Sang-jin's case.

136
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,383
Are you asking me to promote you
to a Presiding Judge?

137
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:32,594
That's too soon.

138
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:36,139
No, I'd like to be
the Reporting Judge for this case.

139
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:37,724
In other words

140
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:39,643
you'd like to be demoted

141
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:41,978
if that's what it takes
to end the case yourself?

142
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:43,813
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:47,901
Alright.

144
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:51,238
Every judge should be
this noble and courageous.

145
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:55,408
Judge Lim, the case is yours,
and so is Judge Lee.

146
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:56,993
Yes, sir.

147
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:13,009
How many cases

148
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:14,844
has Haenal Law Firm taken recently?

149
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:17,597
There have been 12 cases in total
since last year.

150
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:20,433
As directed, I made sure
the court ruled against them every time.

151
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:23,103
There's just one merger case now.

152
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:24,354
Okay.

153
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,944
Hello, sir.

154
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:33,613
It's been a minute.

155
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:35,782
There have been 12 cases

156
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:39,452
and you lost in every one of them.

157
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,455
I can't imagine
Haenal's reputation after that.

158
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:43,623
I know.

159
00:09:44,374 --> 00:09:45,458
I'm ashamed.

160
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:49,796
It's on me for hiring such weak lawyers.

161
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:04,204
It's an issue to have
such incapable employees

162
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:06,873
but it's not good for the owner

163
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:09,876
to blame them entirely, either.

164
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:19,219
You're right.

165
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:20,970
So

166
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:24,599
what should the owner do, then?

167
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:30,063
If you eat too quickly, you get heartburn.

168
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:32,816
But if you just wait around...

169
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:47,414
you'll also lose in your 13th case.

170
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:03,346
Please help me.

171
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:17,110
Whether we flip the coin

172
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:19,612
or set it straight

173
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,074
doesn't it entirely depend
on whose hand it's in?

174
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:30,790
It's the same in court.

175
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,148
Like this?

176
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:22,842
Did you see Seon-cheol's face?

177
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:25,345
When you swirled the soup with your spoon?

178
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:26,679
No.

179
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,349
When I placed the sea cucumber
in his bowl.

180
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:33,853
He seemed mortified.

181
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:36,689
He was about to throw up any minute.

182
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,858
But what can he do about that?

183
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:41,444
This is how you tame people.

184
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:44,030
Had we reached out to Haenal
from the start

185
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:45,532
would he have taken my hand?

186
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:49,369
No, he would've undermined you.

187
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:50,537
Exactly.

188
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:54,541
Smart people with all the wealth think

189
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,710
they're the best
until they're put in their place.

190
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:01,965
Let Haenal win in court this time.

191
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:04,551
It's a reward for holding the coin right.

192
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:08,888
I'll meet with the panel tomorrow.

193
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:16,479
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

194
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,156
His legs got completely wrecked.

195
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,409
I hear he'll be lame for life.

196
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:31,244
That's his punishment.

197
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:34,664
It's like the universe is
the prosecutor and the Justice.

198
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:37,417
I know, right?

199
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:55,268
In my previous life,
I made a wrong call on my first case

200
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,604
and that was the start of my nightmares.

201
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:02,442
It's time to straighten that out.

202
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:20,501
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

203
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:26,132
This concludes my argument.

204
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:30,470
She was just 20.

205
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:33,890
She wasn't supposed to die

206
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,975
so soon, just like that.

207
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:38,478
So, tell me

208
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:40,229
why that bastard is still alive.

209
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:43,232
You hit him with your car.

210
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:45,485
Why didn't you just kill him then?

211
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,237
Because I'm not the one to judge him.

212
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,406
It's the victim's family.

213
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,241
What?

214
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,576
Every night

215
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,746
I curse and strangle Kim Sang-jin.

216
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:00,249
And I hope my desperate thoughts

217
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,085
finally reach him eventually.

218
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:05,588
Pray for a life full of agony

219
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,092
for him.

220
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,682
How can a judge say that?

221
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:17,725
I hope his agony

222
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:23,940
washes away your pain
of losing your daughter.

223
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,798
I have to see that monster again?

224
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:50,925
No.

225
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:54,303
My presence in court won't change
the outcome.

226
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,809
Attending a funeral

227
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:02,145
doesn't bring the dead back, either.

228
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:05,982
Yet, we attend them.

229
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:10,319
For whomever it may be

230
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:13,823
that is how we pay respect
to the dead and their loved ones.

231
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:16,993
But you'll leave it to another person
to prosecute the man

232
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:18,745
who killed your mother?

233
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:23,416
I guess I can write a quick verdict
and go to bed, then.

234
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:26,836
But you're a judge.

235
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,339
Do your job! You're a judge!

236
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:33,760
Is a judge

237
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,264
closer to her than her own son?

238
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:44,937
Reporting Judge Lee Han-young

239
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:48,024
will read the final verdict
to close the case.

240
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,285
Judge Lee.

241
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,414
- May I get up?
- Why?

242
00:18:11,714 --> 00:18:14,300
Who should the victims resent?

243
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:28,231
They say, "Hate his deed,
but don't hate the person."

244
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:31,150
Whoever said that,
I'd like to ask them this.

245
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:35,905
"Who should the victims
and the bereaved hate, then?"

246
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:39,075
Would you still be able to say that

247
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:40,827
if your innocent family died?

248
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:42,703
Hating perpetrators

249
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,997
who hurt your family and neighbors is

250
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:47,333
a human instinct and a given right.

251
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:48,835
Your innocent neighbors

252
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:50,920
not one, but three,
were killed ruthlessly.

253
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:52,004
Not only that

254
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:53,589
but the sole survivor

255
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:55,758
almost became an accomplice
to a mortifying crime.

256
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:01,097
Therefore, I hate him.

257
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:12,024
I'll curse him every single day

258
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,359
and strangle him in my dream.

259
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:15,194
In consideration

260
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,114
of the heartfelt curse

261
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:19,615
of the first victim's family...

262
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:22,785
If there comes a day
Kim Sang-jin gets released

263
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:26,789
I'll wait for him

264
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:29,458
and count the days every day.

265
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:32,712
And the second family's dedicated heart
for revenge...

266
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,884
Mi-ju was

267
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:41,888
a bride-to-be.

268
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,102
I MISS YOU, TOO

269
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,187
The unbearable pain

270
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,898
of the third victim's family,
who died to save someone

271
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:56,694
the sheer fear of the fourth victim,
who almost became an accomplice

272
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:58,654
along with the unlived lives

273
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:00,823
and the weight of the crimes

274
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,327
the court sentences Kim Sang-jin...

275
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,751
to a death penalty

276
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,170
in the final verdict.

277
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:25,473
Right on!

278
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,357
Thank you!

279
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:37,026
Thank you so much, Your Honor!

280
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,280
At last, goodnight for me

281
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:42,782
and goodbye to you.

282
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,533
You bastard.

283
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:50,539
In my previous life, my wrong judgment led

284
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:52,041
a child to die

285
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:53,793
and Ju-yeong to become an accomplice.

286
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:59,715
But this time, I saved them.

287
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:03,970
And

288
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:06,472
I saved myself

289
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:10,309
from a lifetime of nightmares.

290
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,956
Oh, gosh! Are you okay?

291
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:51,225
Don't back up.

292
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,310
Hey.

293
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:54,437
You think the court is the Colosseum?

294
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,023
It's not a venting outlet for victims!

295
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:58,774
It's the least we can do
when we can't behead him.

296
00:21:58,858 --> 00:21:59,859
What?

297
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,862
Whatever it is

298
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:04,447
don't you know
all court decisions are recorded?

299
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,614
So, what's next?

300
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,159
That's why I made sure
the sentence was legally sound.

301
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:10,536
Even legally speaking,
a death sentence made sense.

302
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:11,996
Wow.

303
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:14,582
What a clever, crazy little judge you are!

304
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:19,337
Can we talk in private later?

305
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:20,671
Yes, sir.

306
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:33,934
Any updates on Yi-seok?

307
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:35,811
Has he been talking to anyone?

308
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,022
No, not yet.

309
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:41,859
If he meets with anyone,
make sure to check on them.

310
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:42,943
Yes, sir.

311
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:45,529
And you were in the same cohort
as Judge Lee?

312
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,116
Yes, and we're roommates.

313
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,202
Why are you asking about him?

314
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:56,457
He got bashed on for being so harsh

315
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,709
but he seems to be way more than that.

316
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,631
- What?
- Sorry?

317
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:05,716
Nothing, sir.

318
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,926
You should head back.

319
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:12,139
They started colluding here?

320
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:13,891
How long have they been a team for?

321
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,872
Nice to see you again, Sin-jin.

322
00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:35,556
Yi-seok hasn't been up to much so far.

323
00:24:36,056 --> 00:24:38,893
Has he really lost all his claws?

324
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:43,898
I'll keep an eye on him.

325
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:48,569
But do you really need to keep an eye
on Yi-seok, anyway?

326
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:52,406
Isn't it over since he's been demoted
to the Chungnam District Court?

327
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:55,326
Yi-seok is resilient.

328
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:59,246
His resilience alone earned him trust
from the Judiciary.

329
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,751
But it's too much.
He's too strict with the rules.

330
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:05,794
He'll definitely go against me

331
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:07,838
if he ever returns
to the Seoul District Court.

332
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:12,593
Why don't you take
his judge's robe for good, then?

333
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:14,261
Despite that

334
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:18,516
the Judiciary needs at least one person
like Yi-seok.

335
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:22,019
To keep the rotten ones from taking over.

336
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:26,106
I see.

337
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:31,445
How many politicians are in a lawsuit?

338
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:35,366
Four from the ruling party
and five from the opposition

339
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:37,535
for bribery and illegal political funding.

340
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:38,869
Who are the judges?

341
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:41,539
I made sure they were
from the Hanwool Research Association.

342
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:43,290
The opposition party criticized

343
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:45,042
the Judiciary's recent ruling, right?

344
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,126
Yes, sir.

345
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:48,796
Align the verdicts

346
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,298
with the prosecutors' indictment
for the opposition.

347
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:54,802
We have to teach them what happens

348
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:56,470
when they challenge our authority.

349
00:25:58,222 --> 00:25:59,223
Yes, sir.

350
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,892
And the companies caught for tax evasion?

351
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:03,477
Right.

352
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:06,647
I suggested that the judges charge

353
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,650
only 30% of the initial charge
in the second trial

354
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:12,403
in exchange for 20% in commission.

355
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:14,989
This means the companies only pay

356
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:17,491
half of what they actually owe

357
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:19,076
so they'll definitely take it.

358
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,661
Okay.

359
00:27:03,537 --> 00:27:07,666
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

360
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:29,063
Your son was fair in court this time.

361
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:36,236
I'm not too late this time, am I?

362
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:39,073
Ms. Shin!

363
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:43,410
My son!

364
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:45,329
Back then, I called my mom

365
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:47,039
"Ms. Shin."

366
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:48,749
Weren't you going to come on Saturday?

367
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:54,755
Oh, my.

368
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,507
What's wrong with you? Huh?

369
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:58,676
Hey.

370
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,850
What judge works so late into the night?

371
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:08,519
My poor boy. You must be exhausted.

372
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,938
I had an errand to run nearby.

373
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:12,356
But I have to return tonight.

374
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:14,942
Is something wrong?

375
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:17,945
Do you need money?

376
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:20,447
Is work getting too hard?

377
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:24,743
- Your girlfriend left you, didn't she?
- No!

378
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:27,996
My gosh.

379
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,042
Come on.

380
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:34,795
Your Honor, you don't need to do this.

381
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:37,798
Man, sitting at my desk all day

382
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:39,466
makes me feel like I'm rotting.

383
00:28:39,883 --> 00:28:41,468
My knees and joints are getting bad

384
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:43,887
maybe because I'm in my 40s now.

385
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:47,975
You should take care of your health.

386
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:49,727
Should I bring some joint supplements?

387
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,812
Stop it. You're not over 40.

388
00:28:52,312 --> 00:28:53,397
People will hear you

389
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,149
and think I'm an old lady.

390
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,067
No, I'm not over 40.

391
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:58,819
I'm just saying I feel like I am.

392
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:01,071
Preventive measures are best
for staying healthy.

393
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:04,408
Take care of your own body.

394
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,578
Since when were you so chatty?

395
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,330
I can't do this.

396
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:12,249
Are you complaining about it?

397
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:15,419
No, I love how chatty you are.

398
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:28,932
Weren't you coming on Saturday?

399
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:31,935
He had something to do nearby.
He's just visiting for a bit.

400
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,108
I still can't look at Father in his eyes.

401
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,779
Is the car outside yours?

402
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,530
Yes, I got a used car.

403
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:46,116
Should we get him to drive us home?

404
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,702
- Can you drive us?
- Of course.

405
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,037
Have dinner at home, then.

406
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,538
Do you have time for kimchi stew?

407
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,040
Yeah, I'm starving.

408
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:54,625
Let's go now.

409
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:55,709
Let's go, honey.

410
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,795
Just close the gate first.

411
00:29:57,878 --> 00:29:58,879
Hello.

412
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:00,214
My, my.

413
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,633
Hello.

414
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:04,218
Hello.

415
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:05,803
You're the owners, right?

416
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:07,471
- Yes.
- Yes.

417
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:10,349
Soon told me to come here.

418
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:12,100
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

419
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:13,185
It's okay.

420
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:15,938
You came right on time.
We were about to close.

421
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,070
Find a complicated case
and assign it to Judge Lee.

422
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:25,572
He just started his sole trials.

423
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:28,909
Don't you think it's too early
to assign him

424
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:30,077
to a complex case?

425
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,745
That's the whole point.

426
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,957
I'm curious

427
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,375
as to what he'll do.

428
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:40,295
We will begin the trial

429
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:43,632
for Case 2025GD1435,
involving Defendant Park Hyeok-jun.

430
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:46,552
You have the right to remain silent

431
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:48,554
and only make statements favorable to you.

432
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:52,724
Please state your name, ID number,
and address.

433
00:30:57,396 --> 00:30:59,398
My name is Park Hyeok-jun.

434
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:03,735
My address is 234, Yeong-il-dong,
Mayeong-gu, Seoul.

435
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:08,532
KIM SEON-HUI

436
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:16,164
Why are you here?

437
00:31:16,248 --> 00:31:18,750
How dare you come here?

438
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:21,670
Bring my Seon-hui back to life!

439
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:24,506
Bring her back!

440
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:26,842
I didn't do it.

441
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:29,011
- I really didn't.
- No?

442
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:31,597
I don't believe you!

443
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,516
You killed my daughter
to take her insurance money!

444
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,101
You killed her!

445
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:37,853
Honey!

446
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,188
- Honey!
- Auntie!

447
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:41,315
Auntie!

448
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,691
Auntie.

449
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:44,151
Oh, no.

450
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:49,781
Ms. Kim Seon-hui signed up
for life insurance

451
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:51,950
three months before the accident.

452
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,619
But the beneficiary was

453
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:55,537
not anyone from Ms. Kim's family

454
00:31:55,954 --> 00:31:57,789
but instead, her fiancé

455
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:00,208
and the defendant of the case,
Mr. Park Hyeok-jun.

456
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:03,462
I cannot help but question the situation
as a prosecutor.

457
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:06,131
The restaurant that Mr. Park runs

458
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:08,383
in the city earned

459
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:11,136
about 2.5 million won per month
in net profit.

460
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:13,388
That means he earned
about 300 million won annually.

461
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:15,307
Therefore, I cannot help but doubt

462
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,391
the idea of Mr. Park

463
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:18,810
committing a murder

464
00:32:18,894 --> 00:32:21,730
for that insurance money.

465
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,649
Moreover, Mr. Park knew nothing

466
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:26,151
about Ms. Kim signing up

467
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:27,736
for life insurance

468
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,905
and there's no proof that he did.

469
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:39,498
How can you get a complicated case
right after solving a murder case?

470
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:41,083
Man...

471
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,834
You're the unluckiest guy

472
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:44,503
in history.

473
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,338
- Is that instant coffee?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:49,758
Why? You never have any.
It's too sweet for you.

475
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:52,260
No, I don't. But it smells nice.

476
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:53,762
Where are you going?

477
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:54,846
The site of Ms. Kim's accident.

478
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,848
You won't find anything there.

479
00:32:56,932 --> 00:32:59,184
You don't even have enough time
to write the verdict.

480
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:01,269
Are you going to write it at home?

481
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:03,021
Homework is for high school kids.

482
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:09,861
Do you always have to have the last word?

483
00:33:13,323 --> 00:33:14,658
Seriously.

484
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:21,873
Man.

485
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,875
You can't tell me

486
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:25,961
he's sane.

487
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:27,963
Wow.

488
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:29,548
What is this?

489
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:33,093
KIM JIN-HAN
FROM SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

490
00:33:34,594 --> 00:33:35,637
Yes, Mr. Kim?

491
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:49,985
Hey, Ms. Shin.

492
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:51,653
Did you have dinner?

493
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:53,989
I'll be home late today.

494
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:55,657
Yeah.

495
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:57,242
By the way

496
00:33:57,993 --> 00:34:00,245
you know the old lady
who came to the junkyard?

497
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:03,999
Oh, the scrap paper lady
who came at night?

498
00:34:04,082 --> 00:34:05,667
Does she live near there?

499
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:07,252
I'm not sure.

500
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:09,171
Judging by how she brings us scraps

501
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:10,505
she probably does. Why?

502
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:12,674
Nothing. I just thought of her.

503
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:14,342
That's random.

504
00:34:15,177 --> 00:34:17,345
You'll sleep at home tomorrow, right?
It's Saturday.

505
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,430
Yup!

506
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,348
See you later, Ms. Shin.

507
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,777
It should be right about here.

508
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:06,478
NO ENTRY

509
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:19,491
UNDER POLICE INVESTIGATION

510
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:26,915
THE EXTERAL VIEW OF THE CAR
AFTER THE ACCIDENT

511
00:36:08,915 --> 00:36:11,126
At first, I thought it was an accident.

512
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:13,712
But it turned into a lawsuit

513
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:16,965
when Ms. Kim turned out to have signed up
for eight life insurances

514
00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:18,466
worth 1.2 billion won

515
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,552
all with the beneficiary being her fiancé

516
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:22,304
Mr. Park Hyeok-jun.

517
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:23,889
Excuse me.

518
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:31,479
Hello.

519
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:33,398
You're a detective, right?

520
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:36,484
I've never met such a handsome detective.

521
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:38,570
You're surprised
because I blew your cover.

522
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:40,822
My intuition is

523
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,157
just on another level.

524
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:46,494
Nice to meet you.

525
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:48,914
I'm Song Na-yeon,
a reporter at Daejin Daily.

526
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:53,835
Song Na-yeon, the legal correspondent
at Daejin Daily?

527
00:36:54,586 --> 00:36:57,505
Will the death of S Construction's CEO
affect the ruling?

528
00:36:58,089 --> 00:36:59,090
Mr. Lee!

529
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:01,259
Mr. Lee, please say something...

530
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:05,931
Please get out of my way.

531
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:07,182
Sir!

532
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:08,516
So, we meet again.

533
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:12,437
You must be here
for Ms. Kim Seon-hui's case.

534
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,274
No need to be that surprised.

535
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:17,776
You're in the middle of nowhere

536
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:18,860
with your car there

537
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:20,362
snooping around in the mountains

538
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:21,446
in the heat.

539
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:23,615
I can just tell
by how you're snooping around.

540
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:25,700
It's pretty obvious, don't you think?

541
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:27,619
Oh, you must be curious

542
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:29,704
about why a legal correspondent is here.

543
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:30,789
I didn't ask.

544
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:32,958
Where should I even begin?

545
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,626
Since you must be curious

546
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:35,961
allow me to explain.

547
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:37,879
Ms. Kim, who recently died

548
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:40,548
was actually my friend.

549
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:43,134
No need to feel bad for me or anything.

550
00:37:43,218 --> 00:37:44,970
We weren't best friends or anything.

551
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:46,554
We just knew each other

552
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:48,306
for a very long time.

553
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,808
But Detective

554
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:51,685
what do you think about the case?

555
00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:53,478
Do you think Park Hyeok-jun really did it?

556
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:54,646
I have a feeling

557
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:57,816
he killed her for the insurance payout.

558
00:37:57,899 --> 00:37:58,900
Right?

559
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:01,569
Are you done? Is it my turn to talk?

560
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:03,571
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

561
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:07,409
Reporter Song Na-yeon at Daejin Daily?

562
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:08,493
Yup.

563
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:09,995
Can you get the word out

564
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:12,163
about the case as much as possible?

565
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:13,999
It's best to get the public involved.

566
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:15,250
Yeah, of course.

567
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,085
I'll do anything.

568
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:19,838
Please, just find the person
behind Seon-hui's death.

569
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:21,589
Oh, your friend, Ms. Kim?

570
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:22,924
- Yeah.
- Do you know

571
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:26,011
her cousin, Ms. Kim Ga-yeong, then?

572
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:29,514
Yeah, I do. We all hung out with Seon-hui.

573
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:35,770
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

574
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:54,039
How does your trolley never break?

575
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:56,541
It's uphill, too!

576
00:38:56,624 --> 00:38:58,626
How did you bring all this?

577
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,795
Don't you worry about that.

578
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:03,715
Just give me a good price for these.

579
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:05,717
Ms. Shin!

580
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,469
- Hi.
- Hey, Han-young.

581
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:08,803
Oh, Han-young.

582
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,973
This is my son. He's a judge.

583
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:17,479
Wow, I didn't know
you had such an accomplished son!

584
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:22,067
He must be the most upright person
if he's a judge.

585
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:36,039
What's going on?

586
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:37,415
What?

587
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:38,833
You said that was too sweet.

588
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:43,338
I've tasted enough bitterness.

589
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:45,548
- What?
- Take your call.

590
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:48,718
This is for my Ms. Shin.

591
00:39:50,095 --> 00:39:51,096
Hey.

592
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:52,847
And for you, Father.

593
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:54,182
Thanks.

594
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,351
Have some coffee.

595
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:57,685
Oh, my.

596
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:00,021
- A coffee from Your Honor?
- I pronounce

597
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:01,106
I'm honored.

598
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:03,775
that the Plaintiffs' claims are
hereby dismissed.

599
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:05,693
My Na-yeong...

600
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:08,196
My poor baby.

601
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:13,284
I'm sorry.

602
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:14,369
For what?

603
00:40:15,495 --> 00:40:16,621
Why?

604
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,710
Well, I made your coffee

605
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:24,546
too watery.

606
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:25,880
Oh!

607
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:27,715
I should've made it better.

608
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:29,300
It's fine.

609
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:31,886
The older you get,
the blander your food should be.

610
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,638
That's the secret to good health.

611
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:38,476
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

612
00:40:39,894 --> 00:40:42,730
It's 8,400 won,
but you can take 9,000 won.

613
00:40:42,814 --> 00:40:45,400
- Oh, gosh. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

614
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:48,987
Thanks so much for the coffee!

615
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,238
- Sure.
- You're welcome.

616
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:51,656
Get home safely.

617
00:40:54,075 --> 00:40:55,577
Should we have dinner

618
00:40:56,578 --> 00:40:58,580
at home or out?

619
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:00,748
No, you're always eating out.

620
00:41:00,832 --> 00:41:02,250
Let's just eat at home.

621
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:05,336
Wait, I forgot something.

622
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,256
You two can have dinner without me.

623
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:09,424
Enjoy!

624
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:20,268
Kim Yun-cheol, is it?

625
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:24,022
No, it's Kim Yoon-hyeok.

626
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:26,107
Oh, yeah, Yoon-hyeok.

627
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:28,526
- Let me pour you one.
- Yes, sir.

628
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:33,364
Thank you.

629
00:41:38,953 --> 00:41:40,371
So, is Justice Kim Jun-man

630
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:43,166
the next Chief Justice, then?

631
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:46,294
Yeah, I've decided.

632
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:48,296
Have you decided
on Chief Judge Baek Yi-seok

633
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:51,382
as the new Justice, then?

634
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:54,219
The Justice has the final say
in every case

635
00:41:54,552 --> 00:41:56,221
but has no appointment power.

636
00:41:56,304 --> 00:41:58,973
That's where we'll leave
Yi-seok's claws to become dull.

637
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:00,892
And he'll just use his dull claws

638
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:03,978
to banish all the corrupt ones.

639
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,398
That might put our people at risk.

640
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:08,816
That's not so bad, either.

641
00:42:09,984 --> 00:42:11,402
The more threatened you feel

642
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:13,404
the more desperate you get for a lifeline.

643
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:21,079
I sometimes wonder

644
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:23,831
how it would've been
if I sided with Yi-seok.

645
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:28,419
But no fish can survive in water
that's too clear.

646
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:32,090
If the water is too clear

647
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:35,218
big fish can't live in it.

648
00:42:37,762 --> 00:42:38,930
What do you think?

649
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:42,183
Sorry?

650
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:45,186
Oh...

651
00:42:45,687 --> 00:42:48,606
Well, I think

652
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:51,693
it only takes a second

653
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:55,238
for clear water to become polluted.

654
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,532
I think you should stay put

655
00:42:58,032 --> 00:43:01,119
and wait for the water to become polluted.

656
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:03,705
Interesting.

657
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:07,542
I hear there's an interesting judge
at the Chungnam Court.

658
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:09,627
Lee Han-young, is it?

659
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:11,713
Yes, sir, the one I mentioned.

660
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:17,468
We were in the same judge cohort.

661
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:21,306
We were in law school at the same time,
but went to different schools.

662
00:43:21,973 --> 00:43:23,057
Judge Lee graduated

663
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:25,059
from a smaller law school.

664
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,899
He'll be forgotten pretty soon
without a good leader.

665
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:42,160
I've been at the Chungnam District Court
for two years.

666
00:43:42,827 --> 00:43:45,330
I've been staying there for two years,
counting on you guys

667
00:43:46,914 --> 00:43:50,001
yet he doesn't even remember my name.

668
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:53,588
He was just confused for a second.

669
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:57,175
He knows how you feel
and how loyal you are.

670
00:44:00,762 --> 00:44:02,347
How come he remembers

671
00:44:03,014 --> 00:44:05,266
Han-young's name, then?

672
00:44:09,312 --> 00:44:10,313
Why

673
00:44:11,606 --> 00:44:12,857
do you think so?

674
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,111
Grandma!

675
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:18,529
There you are.

676
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:27,622
Grandma, I'm in high school next year

677
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:28,706
so just hang on.

678
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,625
I'll get a job as soon as I graduate
from high school.

679
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:33,127
Why would you get a job?

680
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:36,631
If I don't go to college,
I can save four years' of tuition

681
00:44:36,714 --> 00:44:38,800
and make money. It's a win-win.

682
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:40,760
It's like you want me to get mad.

683
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,305
You don't need to become a judge

684
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:48,476
but I at least need my granddaughter
to graduate from college.

685
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:50,395
A judge? That's random.

686
00:44:51,062 --> 00:44:53,731
The owner of the convenience store
gave these to me.

687
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:55,650
They expired, so I got them for free.

688
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:59,654
Don't drink the junkyard coffee
and call it a dinner. Eat this.

689
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:02,573
Do you want me to get food poisoning?

690
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:05,076
They're expired, but not rotten.

691
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:06,577
You don't know anything.

692
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:09,664
Well, here we finally are.

693
00:45:09,997 --> 00:45:11,249
Just get the door.

694
00:45:19,173 --> 00:45:21,175
You can drink all the milk.

695
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:01,549
Good morning.

696
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:03,217
Have a good day.

697
00:46:25,698 --> 00:46:26,908
My room!

698
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:30,578
It's exactly how it was ten years ago!

699
00:46:31,746 --> 00:46:32,747
Hold up.

700
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:36,834
2025.

701
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:39,921
I'm still here!

702
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,008
I can't keep saying
I'll do everything later.

703
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:46,093
One day, it'll be too late for anything.

704
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:48,012
Since it's the first day

705
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:50,097
I prepared breakfast for you.

706
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:51,182
"The first day"?

707
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:53,351
This was what you eventually wanted to do?

708
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:54,519
Why? Is it bad?

709
00:46:54,602 --> 00:46:57,522
Well, I'll have to taste it first.

710
00:47:00,775 --> 00:47:03,528
I would've really regretted it
if I'd had this later.

711
00:47:03,611 --> 00:47:05,613
Han-young, please do this more often.

712
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:08,866
I also prepared this.

713
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,117
What is it?

714
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:12,203
Oh, I'm really fine. I'm healthy.

715
00:47:12,286 --> 00:47:15,414
You have to take care of your health
while it's good.

716
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,041
I'm really fine.

717
00:47:17,124 --> 00:47:18,125
Really?

718
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:19,961
We can't chuck his gift in the trash.

719
00:47:20,044 --> 00:47:21,712
I guess I'll take it all.

720
00:47:23,297 --> 00:47:24,966
It's perfect.

721
00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:27,009
I've been aching after work every day.

722
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:35,434
- I...
- Is it good?

723
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:36,894
Yeah, it's great.

724
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:39,438
My wrists have been a bit sore

725
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:41,148
from working and doing chores.

726
00:47:41,232 --> 00:47:43,818
But you didn't want them.
You said you were fine.

727
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:45,653
I wouldn't say I'm perfectly fine.

728
00:47:45,736 --> 00:47:47,488
I'm aching all over.

729
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:48,573
I'm in my menopause.

730
00:47:48,656 --> 00:47:50,575
- I'm dying here!
- I knew this would happen

731
00:47:50,658 --> 00:47:52,827
so I got another box
to keep you two from fighting.

732
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,248
Thank you.

733
00:47:57,331 --> 00:47:58,332
I'll take two, too.

734
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:01,168
Hello?

735
00:48:02,169 --> 00:48:04,171
Yes, Mr. Lim, is everything okay?

736
00:48:09,093 --> 00:48:10,261
Did Han-young

737
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:13,180
leave this here?

738
00:48:13,264 --> 00:48:15,433
Yeah, he asked us to make it
for the elders

739
00:48:15,516 --> 00:48:17,768
instead of instant coffee.

740
00:48:17,852 --> 00:48:20,271
Some drink the coffee and call it a meal.

741
00:48:20,688 --> 00:48:22,440
He told me to use two packs per cup.

742
00:48:22,857 --> 00:48:23,858
Okay.

743
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:26,527
Doesn't Han-young seem different?

744
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:28,779
He was a bit different this morning, too.

745
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,781
I know, right?

746
00:48:31,198 --> 00:48:32,700
He even drank instant coffee.

747
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:34,452
He never drank that.

748
00:48:34,785 --> 00:48:36,537
Can I have a cup of this?

749
00:48:38,205 --> 00:48:39,957
Park Hyeok-jun and the prosecutor's claims

750
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:41,709
are both plausible.

751
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:43,461
So, as with the saying

752
00:48:43,544 --> 00:48:45,296
"When in doubt, rule for the accused"

753
00:48:45,379 --> 00:48:48,966
Park Hyeok-jun was declared innocent
in my previous life.

754
00:48:50,885 --> 00:48:52,803
But three years later

755
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:55,222
it was uncovered
that Park planned the car crash

756
00:48:55,306 --> 00:48:58,309
to kill his fiancée, Ms. Kim.

757
00:48:59,393 --> 00:49:00,561
You have a blind date.

758
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,730
Mr. Yu, the Partner at Haenal Law Firm

759
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:04,482
asked Chief Judge to set you up

760
00:49:04,565 --> 00:49:06,984
with his youngest daughter
for solving the murder case.

761
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:09,570
It's his youngest daughter.

762
00:49:09,654 --> 00:49:11,989
Go to the cafe at Ramando Hotel
in Gangnam by 2 p.m.

763
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:22,416
I purposely came an hour late,
and he didn't even call.

764
00:49:23,834 --> 00:49:24,919
I like him already.

765
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,756
He has to be patient
if he wants to date me.

766
00:49:38,766 --> 00:49:39,767
What?

767
00:49:40,017 --> 00:49:41,435
Don't tell me he's not even here.

768
00:49:48,943 --> 00:49:49,944
Oh.

769
00:49:50,277 --> 00:49:51,696
Of course.

770
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,125
Oh, gosh!

771
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:06,460
What?

772
00:50:07,962 --> 00:50:09,005
Huh?

773
00:50:11,215 --> 00:50:13,134
I'm Lee Han-young. I'm running a bit late.

774
00:50:13,217 --> 00:50:16,095
He's coming even later?
It's already an hour past.

775
00:50:16,178 --> 00:50:18,305
What? Me?

776
00:50:19,724 --> 00:50:20,891
Do you

777
00:50:21,726 --> 00:50:22,810
know me?

778
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:26,814
You think?

779
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,031
A YOUNG MAN DIES
FROM A SINKHOLE IN NAMMYEON-GU

780
00:50:37,324 --> 00:50:39,827
Se-hee was an hour late to the date
in my previous life.

781
00:50:40,578 --> 00:50:42,872
That's how she tames people.

782
00:50:57,094 --> 00:50:58,512
I might take even longer.

783
00:50:59,513 --> 00:51:00,765
Are you kidding me?

784
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:05,311
Does he realize who I am?

785
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:19,950
Sorry!

786
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:24,371
You're kidding me.

787
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:26,874
First, I get stood up by a nobody,
and now, this?

788
00:51:26,957 --> 00:51:30,294
Sorry, I'll pay for dry-cleaning.

789
00:51:30,377 --> 00:51:31,879
Shut your face.

790
00:51:32,546 --> 00:51:34,799
This dress is worthless
as soon as it touches water.

791
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:38,052
So, pay for the dress,
not for dry-cleaning.

792
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,971
You got 12 million won?

793
00:51:42,181 --> 00:51:44,642
- Sorry?
- The dress was 12 million won.

794
00:51:46,811 --> 00:51:47,895
No?

795
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:52,066
Pay for it with this, then.

796
00:51:58,656 --> 00:51:59,740
Who the hell are you?

797
00:52:00,991 --> 00:52:02,743
Why do you keep getting in my way?

798
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,328
I'm Lee Han-young.

799
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:07,998
The nobody who almost stood you up.

800
00:52:20,928 --> 00:52:22,763
- Whoa.
- Get out.

801
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,015
How dare you make me wait?

802
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:29,854
I'm sorry I made you wait

803
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:32,606
but I can sue you for assault.

804
00:52:33,274 --> 00:52:34,859
We have plenty of witnesses, too.

805
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:36,360
Sue me, then.

806
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:38,279
You think you can hurt me

807
00:52:38,362 --> 00:52:40,364
when I've just slapped you once?

808
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:45,786
You're just a mere judge.

809
00:52:46,203 --> 00:52:47,788
If Haenal's youngest daughter

810
00:52:47,872 --> 00:52:50,207
gets sued by a mere judge

811
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,376
the press would go wild for it.

812
00:52:53,043 --> 00:52:54,211
You sure about that?

813
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:58,382
What?

814
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:02,386
You caused all of this trouble.

815
00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:03,888
So

816
00:53:04,305 --> 00:53:06,056
apologize to the server.

817
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,976
I won't sue you, then.

818
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:13,230
In the previous life,
Se-hee tried to take over Haenal

819
00:53:13,314 --> 00:53:15,316
by beating her older siblings.

820
00:53:15,399 --> 00:53:18,736
So, there's no way she can do anything

821
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:19,987
to bother Mr. Yu.

822
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:21,739
Sorry.

823
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:23,991
Don't worry about the dress.

824
00:53:24,074 --> 00:53:26,327
Noblesse Oblige.

825
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,078
No, I'll do anything to...

826
00:53:28,162 --> 00:53:29,163
Really?

827
00:53:31,582 --> 00:53:33,250
Just thank me and go.

828
00:53:34,543 --> 00:53:35,836
Thank you.

829
00:53:49,266 --> 00:53:51,518
You think you're the shit now, don't you?

830
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:16,210
Or do I look desperate
to catch a rich lady?

831
00:54:19,213 --> 00:54:20,547
What the hell is he doing?

832
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:26,720
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

833
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:28,889
It's about time
you become the Chief Justice.

834
00:54:30,182 --> 00:54:32,685
You'll get a call
from the President's Office soon.

835
00:54:36,146 --> 00:54:37,731
Thank you.

836
00:54:37,815 --> 00:54:39,566
I'll protect the Judiciary

837
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,735
with a love for my nation.

838
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:43,904
Make sure you make zero mistakes

839
00:54:43,988 --> 00:54:46,407
until the day you're appointed.

840
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,491
In particular

841
00:54:48,325 --> 00:54:50,494
do not ever forget

842
00:54:50,577 --> 00:54:51,996
who made this happen.

843
00:54:53,747 --> 00:54:54,999
This is Kang Sin-jin.

844
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:58,168
The President's Office will appoint
Justice Kim Jun-man

845
00:54:58,252 --> 00:55:00,337
as the next Chief Justice.

846
00:55:01,338 --> 00:55:03,424
The Congress will pass
the motion for appointment consent

847
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:05,175
as soon as it arrives.

848
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:08,846
PARTY LEADER CHO HU-HEON

849
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:11,015
They've started
an internal investigation on me?

850
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,351
Okay.

851
00:55:16,854 --> 00:55:18,689
Doesn't an internal investigation mean

852
00:55:19,773 --> 00:55:22,026
you've been chosen to become a Justice?

853
00:55:23,527 --> 00:55:24,528
Well...

854
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:28,365
Congratulations on your promotion.

855
00:55:30,034 --> 00:55:32,536
Don't be so dramatic. Just sit.

856
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:44,631
A bride-to-be died in a car accident.

857
00:55:44,715 --> 00:55:46,800
While it seemed like an accident at first

858
00:55:46,884 --> 00:55:49,887
suspicions around the case are growing

859
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:51,722
as more details are revealed.

860
00:55:51,805 --> 00:55:55,059
The bride-to-be had signed up
for eight life insurance plans

861
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:57,644
worth 1.2 billion won in total.

862
00:55:57,728 --> 00:55:59,396
The issue is, all her insurances had

863
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,232
an assigned beneficiary, her fiancé.

864
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:05,486
The two were in the same car
at the time of the accident.

865
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:07,488
The bride-to-be passed away...

866
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:11,075
The case became a big deal

867
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:13,410
and Sin-jin was more likely
to notice me now.

868
00:56:14,078 --> 00:56:16,914
Sin-jin, give me some attention.

869
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:21,919
Who are you, really?

870
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:24,588
Are you really a judge? Not a detective?

871
00:56:25,005 --> 00:56:27,966
WOMAN SLAPPING HER DATE, WHO'S A JUDGE

872
00:56:28,759 --> 00:56:30,677
"The judge-slapping woman"!

873
00:56:31,261 --> 00:56:32,930
I love the sound of that.

874
00:56:33,013 --> 00:56:34,014
Shut it.

875
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:36,100
I knew my little sister was strong

876
00:56:36,183 --> 00:56:37,935
but I didn't expect you to slap a judge.

877
00:56:38,018 --> 00:56:39,603
He was acting cocky.

878
00:56:39,686 --> 00:56:41,605
How dare he tell me
to apologize to the server?

879
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:43,107
She ruined my dress first.

880
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,109
The video shows me
you're the one at fault.

881
00:56:45,192 --> 00:56:47,444
That's impossible, Dad.

882
00:56:48,278 --> 00:56:51,115
In the service industry,
the worker is always in the wrong.

883
00:56:51,198 --> 00:56:52,533
We provide legal services.

884
00:56:52,616 --> 00:56:55,035
Are you saying we're in the wrong
in every case, then?

885
00:56:55,786 --> 00:56:56,954
That mindset is

886
00:56:57,037 --> 00:56:58,622
why you're not suitable for Haenal.

887
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:01,125
Why would you say that now?

888
00:57:03,794 --> 00:57:05,879
You should've left the damn judge
for Ha-na.

889
00:57:05,963 --> 00:57:06,964
Why set him up with me?

890
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:09,967
I don't have time to date and get married.

891
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:12,052
Father

892
00:57:12,302 --> 00:57:14,555
we're taking
the Nammyeon-gu sinkhole case.

893
00:57:14,638 --> 00:57:16,974
District Mayor Chu Yong-jin
just signed it.

894
00:57:20,227 --> 00:57:21,228
Good work.

895
00:57:31,238 --> 00:57:33,490
That bratty judge ruined it all!

896
00:57:36,577 --> 00:57:37,911
Just wait and see, you two.

897
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:41,123
I'll crush you all.

898
00:57:47,504 --> 00:57:49,173
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

899
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:52,885
HAENAL'S YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
HAS NOTHING TO FEAR

900
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:03,687
Were you in Seoul last weekend?

901
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:05,689
Yeah, I stayed at my Mother's.

902
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:08,192
I see.

903
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,574
Did you go to Ramando Hotel,
by any chance?

904
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:18,869
I saw a video of a man getting slapped

905
00:58:19,536 --> 00:58:21,455
and he looks just like you.

906
00:58:21,538 --> 00:58:22,873
A woman slapped him. Gosh.

907
00:58:23,874 --> 00:58:25,125
It's not you, is it?

908
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:29,087
- You saw the video?
- Yeah.

909
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:32,758
Yeah, it's me.

910
00:58:33,967 --> 00:58:37,054
I couldn't turn it down.
Chief Judge's order.

911
00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:39,431
Haenal Law Firm wanted me

912
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:42,059
after hearing
that I arrested a serial killer

913
00:58:42,142 --> 00:58:43,560
or something.

914
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:48,065
Damn, I had no idea back then

915
00:58:48,148 --> 00:58:50,317
but he's so, so insecure.

916
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,529
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

917
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:55,405
- Hmm?
- What?

918
00:58:57,074 --> 00:58:58,325
Of course.

919
00:58:59,993 --> 00:59:01,245
I drank your coffee.

920
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:04,915
And don't shake your legs.
That's bad luck.

921
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:10,003
Everyone, please stand.

922
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:20,514
Hello.

923
00:59:20,597 --> 00:59:22,432
You're a detective, right?

924
00:59:23,016 --> 00:59:24,434
I've never met such a handsome...

925
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:26,520
So, he's really a judge?

926
00:59:36,446 --> 00:59:37,698
Please be seated.

927
00:59:40,617 --> 00:59:42,786
I guess other judges are most curious

928
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:45,956
about how I'll close this tricky case?

929
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:49,960
Big news outlets are here, too?

930
00:59:51,044 --> 00:59:53,880
Can't believe he got a big case
when he just started sole trials.

931
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:55,048
Must feel like torture.

932
00:59:55,132 --> 00:59:57,968
I'd be more comfortable
in the defendant's seat than there.

933
00:59:59,052 --> 01:00:00,971
Let's see how he handles it.

934
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,934
JUDGE

935
01:00:08,729 --> 01:00:11,398
We will begin the trial

936
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:14,151
for Case 2025GD1435,
involving Defendant Park Hyeok-jun.

937
01:00:18,905 --> 01:00:20,240
I've been waiting for you.

938
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,831
You curious, too?

939
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,083
About my final verdict?

940
01:00:35,672 --> 01:00:36,840
As requested in the last session

941
01:00:36,923 --> 01:00:40,093
we will hear from Ms. Kim Ga-yeong,
Ms. Kim's cousin and insurance broker

942
01:00:40,177 --> 01:00:42,846
who will testify as the witness.

943
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:44,348
Please step forward.

944
01:00:54,816 --> 01:00:57,861
I swear that I will speak the truth

945
01:00:57,944 --> 01:00:59,696
the whole truth and nothing but the truth
according to my own conscience

946
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,782
and if there is falsehood in my statement

947
01:01:01,865 --> 01:01:04,368
I shall be punished for perjury.

948
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:11,124
WITNESS

949
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:14,878
You may be punished for perjury

950
01:01:14,961 --> 01:01:16,713
if your statements are false.

951
01:01:16,797 --> 01:01:19,216
Testifying against your own memory

952
01:01:19,299 --> 01:01:21,134
can also be prosecuted as perjury.

953
01:01:23,887 --> 01:01:25,389
Witness, did you know

954
01:01:26,223 --> 01:01:28,642
Mr. Park Hyeok-jun?

955
01:01:29,643 --> 01:01:30,644
Yes.

956
01:01:30,811 --> 01:01:33,563
I met him a few times with Seon-hui.

957
01:01:33,647 --> 01:01:35,440
When the three of you were together

958
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:39,152
has Seon-hui ever mentioned anything
about her eight life insurances?

959
01:01:39,569 --> 01:01:40,654
No.

960
01:01:40,737 --> 01:01:42,072
Then, did you ever hear

961
01:01:42,155 --> 01:01:43,573
about Ms. Kim having told Mr. Park

962
01:01:43,657 --> 01:01:46,201
about her life insurance?

963
01:01:48,578 --> 01:01:49,663
No.

964
01:01:57,337 --> 01:01:58,338
If Mr. Park continues

965
01:01:59,005 --> 01:02:01,091
to insist that he didn't know

966
01:02:01,174 --> 01:02:03,510
he was the beneficiary until the end

967
01:02:03,593 --> 01:02:05,679
Judge Lee will have no option
but to rule him as innocent.

968
01:02:05,762 --> 01:02:09,015
Despite everything pointing to Mr. Park
as the murderer.

969
01:02:11,768 --> 01:02:12,936
Between the questions

970
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:16,189
of the Defendant knowing
about Ms. Kim's life insurance

971
01:02:16,273 --> 01:02:18,859
and why Ms. Kim signed up

972
01:02:18,942 --> 01:02:20,777
for eight life insurances

973
01:02:20,861 --> 01:02:22,446
it'll be more critical to determine

974
01:02:22,529 --> 01:02:24,614
the answer to the first question.

975
01:02:28,618 --> 01:02:29,619
Prosecutor

976
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,246
have you checked Ms. Kim's phone?

977
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:32,330
DEFENDANT

978
01:02:37,669 --> 01:02:41,047
No, there was no need to examine
Ms. Kim's phone.

979
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:42,549
Even after considering

980
01:02:43,049 --> 01:02:45,969
that Ms. Kim seems to have been
the only one

981
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:48,472
who knew about her life insurance

982
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:50,807
and the beneficiary being Mr. Park?

983
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:51,892
Your Honor.

984
01:02:51,975 --> 01:02:54,060
Counsel, the Defendant is in court

985
01:02:54,144 --> 01:02:57,230
for allegedly having killed his fiancée
for insurance money, right?

986
01:02:57,731 --> 01:03:00,567
If that's the case,
wouldn't checking her phone

987
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,235
help your client prove his innocence?

988
01:03:02,986 --> 01:03:05,572
Yes, but this is too unexpected.

989
01:03:05,655 --> 01:03:06,740
I agree.

990
01:03:09,785 --> 01:03:10,827
Counsel

991
01:03:17,501 --> 01:03:19,753
shall the court seize it by authority?

992
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:22,672
No, I agree.

993
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:26,301
- Inspector.
- Yes, Your Honor.

994
01:03:28,345 --> 01:03:29,679
Please give me her phone.

995
01:03:29,763 --> 01:03:32,432
WITNESS

996
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:39,022
Wait.

997
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:43,860
You have another phone
for private use, right?

998
01:03:47,948 --> 01:03:48,949
Excuse me?

999
01:03:53,954 --> 01:03:55,121
Oh, that one.

1000
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:58,291
I recently lost it.

1001
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:21,481
You may take the call.

1002
01:04:33,285 --> 01:04:34,744
DEFENDANT

1003
01:04:53,388 --> 01:04:54,472
Hello?

1004
01:04:58,602 --> 01:04:59,686
Hello?

1005
01:05:02,939 --> 01:05:04,107
Nice to meet you

1006
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:13,450
Ms. Kim Ga-yeong.

1007
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:25,086
THE JUDGE RETURNS

1008
01:05:49,235 --> 01:05:52,238
I hope Sin-jin enjoys this trial.

1009
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,240
What did you lose? Say it clearly.

1010
01:05:54,324 --> 01:05:56,034
Do you know whose house was robbed?

1011
01:05:56,117 --> 01:05:57,702
The Director of Hanguk Hospital.

1012
01:05:57,786 --> 01:06:00,038
I need you to find something.
It's an account book.

1013
01:06:00,121 --> 01:06:02,248
I'm Kim Jin-a, a prosecutor
at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

1014
01:06:02,332 --> 01:06:03,375
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

1015
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,961
Chairman Jang is under emergency arrest.

1016
01:06:06,044 --> 01:06:07,879
To strike Sin-jin and Tae-sik...

1017
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:09,547
We need what they have taken.

1018
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:13,134
Please, just don't kill me!

1019
01:06:13,218 --> 01:06:15,679
I was wondering where it was from,
and it's S Shopping.

1020
01:06:15,762 --> 01:06:18,348
Don't you realize what'll happen
if the world finds out?

1021
01:06:20,892 --> 01:06:22,894
