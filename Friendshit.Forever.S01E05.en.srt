1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,880
Make sure she falls for you,
then you dump her.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,600
If you do it, I will be yours forever.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,340
I love you guys so much.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,140
I always believed that
if you're real with someone,

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,260
they'll be real with you.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,210
I'm really glad
that I have you and Baikhaw with me now.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,020
Baikhaw, I don't want to hurt Tulip anymore.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,290
The more time I spend with her,

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,640
the more I feel bad for her.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,360
It's okay if you don't want to do it anymore.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,860
Just forget it.

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,130
You want her to have nothing left.

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,440
No friends, no family. Why?

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,530
I have my own reason.

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,430
What reason...

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,430
You seem awfully concerned for her.

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,010
Do you like her?

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,950
No.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,010
You're my one and only.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,860
Prove it.

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,560
Prove it that I really am your one and only.

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,720
Get things done with Tulip.

23
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,260
I promise...

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,320
We'll be together.

25
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,420
Okay.

26
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,310
I'll do whatever you say.

[Unblock this Caller]

29
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,430
You okay?

30
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,580
My dad came to see me yesterday.

31
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,020
Oh?

32
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,860
He said he had been trying to call me,

33
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,660
but couldn't get through.

34
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,530
You sure he wasn't just making excuses?

35
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,050
No, it's...

36
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,150
His number was blocked.

37
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,720
It was?

38
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,240
When did I even block his number?

39
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,940
I don't get it.

40
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,960
I thought he didn't want to see me,

41
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,770
and didn't want to talk to me anymore.

42
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,820
But it was actually because
he couldn't get in touch with me

43
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,240
because I blocked his number?

44
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,700
You're always with me.

45
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,540
Do you remember seeing me block him?

46
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,600
How'd I know that?

47
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,910
Maybe you did it when you were drunk?

48
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,250
When I was drunk?

49
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,300
Yeah.

50
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,710
When you were wasted that day,
you mentioned your dad.

51
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,150
I mentioned my dad?

52
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,890
Yeah.

53
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,190
I don't remember that.

54
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,720
You also said...

55
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,816
you...

56
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,600
You'd be happy having
just me and Tao to trust.

57
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,340
I do remember that.

58
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,560
But I really can't recall
talking about my father.

59
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,570
I saw you on your phone.

60
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:00,360
Maybe you unknowingly
blocked his number then?

61
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,750
Well, drunk people, you know?

62
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,080
I guess.

63
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,940
Don't overthink it.

64
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,850
Think of all the things he did.

65
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,060
He betrayed you.

66
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,260
He doesn't seem one bit sorry
for what he did, does he?

67
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,950
When he gets angry at you,

68
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,300
he's just trying to blame you for everything.

69
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,420
He wants you to feel guilty.

70
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,860
I know for a fact that it's because of him
that you don't want to talk to him.

71
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,940
I'm not in the wrong here, am I?

72
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,040
Of course you're not.

73
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,620
You didn't do anything wrong at all.

74
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,470
Why do I feel so awful?

75
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,940
No. He should be the one feeling awful.

76
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,860
Oh, come here.

77
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,800
Thank you.

78
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,340
Yeah.

79
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,190
Let's sit here.

80
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,250
Okay.

81
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,250
Thanks.

82
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,400
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

83
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,690
You and Baikhaw are inseparable these days.

84
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,190
Haven't we always been like that?

85
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,980
She takes good care of me.

86
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,900
She's like my boyfriend, really.

87
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,400
You're right.

88
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,220
Oh, have you talked to Wawwa?

89
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,260
I don't think there's anything else
to talk about.

90
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:15,740
But don't you think
what Wawwa said could be true?

91
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,390
Namo.

92
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,420
If you truly think of me as a friend,
can you stop mentioning Wawwa?

93
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm sick of hearing it.

94
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,250
Sorry.

96
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,800
I'm not in a good mood.

97
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,110
I just had a fight with my dad.

98
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,900
What happened?

99
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,530
My dad got mad at me because
I blocked his number.

100
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,250
But I don't even remember blocking it.

101
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,320
I still haven't talked things out with him.

102
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,870
Don't you wonder it could be
someone else who did it?

103
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,380
Sorry.

104
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,990
- The line was so long.
- Thanks.

105
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,560
What's going on?

106
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,200
Nothing.

107
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,580
Okay.

108
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,200
- Bye.
- Yeah.

109
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,530
Hey, don't stress over it.

110
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,710
Maybe you blocked him when you were drunk.

111
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,230
You want this?

112
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,730
I'm just stumped, is all.

113
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,370
How come I don't remember any of that.

114
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,740
I'd be stumped if you did.
You were wasted.

115
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,140
You're right.

116
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,140
I'm sure your dad will come around.

117
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,740
Don't overthink it.

118
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,730
Let's watch something.

119
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,990
What should we watch?

120
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,120
But I know I'm lucky because...

121
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,950
I have you, Sun.

122
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,220
You make me smile more than those four can.

123
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,740
Get things done with Tulip.

124
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,980
We'll be together.

125
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,580
I'm sorry.

126
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,340
Why did you apologize just now?

127
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,220
I was just...

128
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,360
Never mind.

129
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,540
Let's go back and watch something.

130
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,620
Tao.

131
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,190
You know you can talk to me.

132
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,990
I don't want you to feel like
you're all alone.

133
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,590
I know I have a lot going on right now,

134
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,260
but I do want to be a good girlfriend.

135
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,660
We don't need to hurry.

136
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,700
Let's take our time.

137
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,460
I want to stay with you like this
for a long time.

138
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,940
What are you cooking? Smells good.

139
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,900
Fried rice.

140
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,480
You hung out with Tao today, right?

141
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,060
How was it?

142
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,560
We haven't done it.

143
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
- Oh?
- No need to tiptoe around it.

144
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,780
Were you playing hard to get again?

145
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,700
No, I didn't this time.

146
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,310
But Tao seemed kind of stressed.

147
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,230
It just seemed like he didn't want to do it.

148
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,555
Why?

149
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,010
I don't know.
Maybe he's got something on his mind.

150
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,260
He'll tell me when he's ready, I think.

151
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,930
That looks good.
I'm gonna go to the toilet for a minute.

152
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,040
Hey, Namo. What's up?

153
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,840
Where is Tulip?

154
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,820
She went to the bathroom.

155
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,700
You can leave your message with me.
I'll pass it on to her.

156
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,540
Can you tell her to call me when she's back?

157
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,260
Of course.

160
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,430
Did someone call?

161
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,380
No. I was just sending those photos
we took yesterday to my phone.

162
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,180
I want to keep them.

163
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,980
How's school?

164
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,640
It's alright. Nothing special.

165
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,900
Do you still have to stay out so late?

166
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,570
Sometimes.

It's safer to drive when you have to
come home late.

170
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,860
Thank you, Dad.

171
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,120
Your father is kind enough to help you out.

172
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,130
You have to be a nice boy, Tao.

173
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,340
Don't do anything to risk your scholarship.

174
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,260
My friend's kid got expelled
from school mid-term.

175
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,280
If that happened to you,

176
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,740
I don't think your dad and I
would be able to face anyone.

177
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,050
You have to be careful with your actions,
love.

178
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,700
What the hell got into you?

179
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,060
Huh?

180
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,700
You're even drinking alone?

181
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,310
There are only a few things in my life
that get to me.

182
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,400
School. Family.

183
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,090
You.

184
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,770
What about me now?

185
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,540
I can't do it.

186
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,570
I can't just sleep with Tulip.

187
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,260
What's so hard about that?

188
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,890
- Just screw her like you screw me.
- It's not the same.

189
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,820
- What the hell?
- I don't want to sleep with her.

190
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,030
I don't want to do it,
because I don't want to hurt her.

191
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,480
Don't ask me to do something like that again.

192
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,180
- Hey!
- What now?

193
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,810
We were still talking.

194
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,500
Will you do what I asked you to or not?

195
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,200
If you really want to go out with me,

196
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,820
why would you want me to sleep
with someone else?

197
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,280
I told you I have a reason!

198
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,780
Can't you just freaking do
what I tell you to?

199
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,290
- What if she actually fell for me?
- That's the plan!

200
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,080
I want her to fall for you, head over heels.

201
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,890
- And then you want me to dump her?
- Yes.

202
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,970
I can't do that.

203
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,290
I did think she must have done
something awful to you,

204
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,680
but now I know that someone as nice as her
would never hurt a fly.

205
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,580
Oh, jerk!

206
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,610
Hold on. Do you like her?

207
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,410
You won't do this because
you like her, is that it?

208
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,620
I...

209
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,720
Do you still love me?

210
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,560
Don't you love me anymore?

211
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,090
Well?

212
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,270
Shit.

213
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,730
Namo, what did you do?

214
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,130
- What the hell did you do?
- You two are freaking jerks!

215
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,600
- Leave it! What did you do that for!
- Stay away!

216
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,450
I'll tell Tulip everything.
I'll tell her your stupid scheme!

217
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,730
- Give me your damn phone!
- No!

218
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,886
- Hey!
- No!

219
00:19:32,886 --> 00:19:34,516
Give it to me!

220
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,740
I won't let you hurt Tulip.

221
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,140
What the hell do you think you're doing?

222
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,710
Pick up the phone!

223
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,320
Give it to me!

224
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,060
No!

225
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,030
Tulip, pick up.

226
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,450
Give it to me.

227
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,140
No!

228
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,180
Hey, Namo.

229
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,340
Namo?

230
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,180
Namo?

231
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,400
Namo?

232
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,310
Please... please save my friend.

233
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,700
Namo.

234
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,010
Namo.

235
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,210
Please save my friend.

236
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,090
Please.

237
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,740
- Hey...
- What?

238
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,770
I-I didn't mean to hit him.

239
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,050
He ran into my car!

240
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,350
- I swear he ran right into my car.
- I know!

241
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,700
No one. No one hit him.

242
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,564
No one? No one?

243
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:42,520
- I just didn't mean to!
- You didn't!

244
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,340
I... He ran into my car.

245
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,570
I was just driving.

246
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,720
You didn't do it. No one here did it.

247
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,670
But... what if he was seriously...

248
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,860
Oh, he'll be freaking fine!

249
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,080
- What if he never woke up again?
- Ugh! Stop it!

250
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,410
Stop freaking crying.

251
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,300
No one here hit him.

252
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,960
It was a totally random car.

253
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,750
Okay?

254
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,952
- No...
- We were passing by.

255
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:20,632
We saw him on the street.

256
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,580
We took him to the hospital.

257
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,220
That's it. Nothing else freaking happened.

258
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,626
It can't be that easy.

259
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,150
It is!

260
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,704
Do you want your parents to kill you?

261
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,030
You were drinking.

262
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,190
If you confess, your scholarship is gone.

263
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,200
Your future is over.

264
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,032
You will have nothing left.

265
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,128
What's it gonna be?

266
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,048
[Tulip]

267
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,240
Why would you pick up?

268
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,960
Give it to me.

269
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,920
You idiot! She's our witness!

270
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,344
Give it to me.

271
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,504
Namo?

272
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,720
Tulip.

273
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,370
Namo got hit by a car. What should I do?

274
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,752
What?

275
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:38,280
Hey. Are you okay?

276
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,100
I'm... I'm so scared.

277
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,616
Tao and I were in the car when we saw
Namo in the pool of his own blood.

278
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:52,064
We got here as fast as we could.

279
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:55,670
Good thing you found him.

280
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,712
I'm so scared he'd die...

281
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,710
What did the doctor say?

282
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,304
I don't know. No one told us anything yet.

283
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,272
You're alright now.

284
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:39,536
Tulip.

285
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,976
What was Namo thinking, going out drinking?

286
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:49,130
It's finals week.

287
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,180
I honestly don't take him for a party guy.

288
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,920
There are people who drown their stress
in drinks, right?

289
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,130
Maybe he's hooked up with some girl there?

290
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,016
It's always these nerdy boys who get fooled.

291
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:06,940
I don't think Namo is like that.

292
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,600
If he's not, what was he doing there?

293
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,144
You know that alley is full of bars.

294
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,496
Are you asking because
you're worried about him,

295
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:17,930
or just eager for some gossip?

296
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,416
Come on, Tao.

297
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:22,330
We're genuinely concerned.

298
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:27,100
I think you shouldn't be talking
if you don't know what actually happened.

299
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,260
These talks are doing nothing but harm
for someone who's still in a coma.

300
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,880
Let's go, Tulip.

301
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:41,860
Those girls.

302
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,540
They need to shut up.

303
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,488
I can't help but have questions
just like everyone.

304
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:48,920
Namo isn't a drinker.

305
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,900
Why was he there?

306
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,584
Maybe he had some errand
to run in the area?

307
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,700
I need to ask you something, too.

308
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,230
What were you doing with Baikhaw that day?

309
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,888
I was out drinking with Chain.

310
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:12,472
We ran into Baikhaw at the bar
so I gave her a ride home.

311
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,056
I see.

312
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:16,870
You guys were out drinking.

313
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,728
Are you mad at me for not telling you?

314
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,530
Of course not.

315
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,632
That's cool.

316
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,560
Let's get in the car.

317
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,120
You said it's your dad's old car.

318
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,448
This isn't old.

319
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:35,450
It is.

320
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,648
It needs a princess passenger, though.

321
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:41,064
Please. Here.

322
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,712
Did you hit something?

323
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,396
It's old.

324
00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:56,380
I think that's my dad's doing.

325
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,400
Here.

326
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:10,952
Your bag.

327
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,480
Excuse me.

328
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,456
Are there any security cameras in this area?

329
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,960
The cops already came around asking.

330
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,620
But no, there aren't any.

331
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,456
There aren't?

332
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,850
Excuse me.

333
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,940
Do you know whose car that is?

334
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,912
It belongs to the building owner's son.

335
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,408
It's parked there for days.

336
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,680
Do you happen to have his number?

337
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Can I have it?

338
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,720
Give me your phone.

339
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,264
Welcome to voicemail service.

340
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:51,500
Please leave your message after the tone.

341
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,320
Hello. My name is Tulip.

342
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,128
I have something I'd like to ask you.

343
00:28:57,128 --> 00:28:59,880
Please call me back.

344
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,064
Tulip. It's me.

345
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:24,384
What the hell are you doing?

346
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,688
I know you wouldn't meet me if I asked,

347
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:30,220
so I was waiting for you.

348
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,810
Now I don't want to talk to you even more.

349
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,500
But I really have to talk to you.

350
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,430
I know it sounds unbelievable,

351
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,008
but we've been friends for a long time.

352
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:43,728
Please believe me. Just this once.

353
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,650
I asked around about Baikhaw
from her high school classmates.

354
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,128
Look.

355
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,920
The reason Baikhaw was banned at school

356
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,400
was because she poisoned an older student.
[Student poisoned by friend at high school]

357
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,290
What the hell are you talking about?

358
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,000
The school was trying to cover up because
they were protecting their reputation

359
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
and because they lacked evidence.

360
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,620
But she was the only person with a motive.

361
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,260
Motive?

362
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,310
What motive?

363
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,824
Tulip.

364
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:19,376
Her high school friends all said that
Baikhaw and Tao were...

365
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,840
Did you need to rope Tao into this?

366
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,240
I'm not making this up.

367
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,328
The girl who got poisoned
is Tao's ex-girlfriend.

368
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:38,160
Those two have been screwing since then.

369
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,656
Those two only got to be friends
because of me.

370
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:44,416
I don't know why she's doing this to you,

371
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:47,750
but she got in my way because
she didn't want me to warn you.

372
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:52,360
Namo got hit by a car because
he knows about this, too.

373
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,848
I think that could be possible.

374
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:55,464
That's enough, Wawwa.

375
00:30:55,464 --> 00:30:56,952
- You're insane.
- Tulip.

376
00:30:56,952 --> 00:30:58,752
Tulip, listen to me.

377
00:30:58,752 --> 00:31:00,336
Tulip.

378
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,240
Baikhaw.

379
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,040
Let's stop.

380
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,740
What the hell now?

381
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,700
How can you still feel like doing it?

382
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,864
Namo is still in the ICU.

383
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:19,900
And?

384
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,570
Is he gonna get up and walk
if we don't screw today?

385
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,216
I ran him over.

386
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,552
I couldn't sleep last night because the image
was still replaying in my head.

387
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:30,530
I can't get in the mood for this.

388
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,620
You're going too far.

389
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,856
You lied to Tulip and everyone
as if nothing happened.

390
00:31:34,856 --> 00:31:38,120
You think I should act suspicious
to give people a damn hint?

391
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,280
Don't be an idiot.

392
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,776
You don't even feel guilty!

393
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,808
What the hell?

394
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,696
You're so scary right now.

395
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,380
- It's like I don't know you at all.
- No one knows me better than you do.

396
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,328
And that's all the more scary.

397
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,808
I'm scared that the more I get to know you,
understand you,

398
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:58,024
it would only mean that
I'm an asshole just like you.

399
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,380
You jerk.

400
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,840
Don't you forget
I was the only witness that night.

401
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,010
Imagine if I just open my mouth,

402
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,304
I can ruin your entire future.

403
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:19,230
- Baikhaw, you...
- What?

404
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,650
Just think of it for a sec
that if everyone finds out

405
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,032
that you were dead drunk
and hit someone with your car...

406
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,260
Your parents, your scholarship, your future,

407
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,660
what would happen?

408
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,488
- Are you threatening me?
- Not at all.

409
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:40,248
I mean every word.

410
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,704
Now if Tulip finds out,
you think she's gonna love you the same?

411
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,896
I wouldn't be able to do that to you, though.

412
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,376
You know you're the only one I have.

413
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:12,740
I can't possibly do that to you.

414
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:18,670
Just do everything as normal,

415
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,240
and we'll be together.

416
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,432
Take off your shirt.

417
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,920
I was out drinking with Chain.

418
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,600
We ran into Baikhaw at the bar
so I gave her a ride home.

421
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,304
Did Tao go out drinking with you
the other night?

422
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,567

424

Tulip, what's up?

425
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,490
Ja?

426
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:57,950
Did Chain happen to grab Tao's cardigan

427
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,008
when they were out drinking on Friday night?

428
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:03,580
It's really expensive.

429
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,024
Chain was with me that night, Tulip.

430
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:09,960
It's been a while since he went anywhere
with Tao, actually.

431
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,288
It's alright, then. Thank you.

432
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,000
I didn't find him.

433
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,712
Two of my friends got him here.

434
00:35:24,712 --> 00:35:26,580
I followed them here later.

435
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,520
We've gone to the scene and investigated,

436
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,672
but there were no witnesses at all,

437
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:36,580
and no camera security footage.

438
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,870
Can you tell your friends to come down to the
station so we can ask them some questions?

439
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,470
Of course.

440
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,160
One more thing,
the police got there too late,

441
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,456
your friends who got the victim here
already left.

442
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:51,140
We didn't get a chance
to get their toxin report.

443
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,680
Are you sure your friends weren't drunk?

444
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,632
From what I remember, they weren't.

445
00:35:57,632 --> 00:36:00,530
They were just in shock.

446
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,128
And the car that got them here?

447
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:03,760
Anything worth noting?

448
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,020
Scratches and such, for example.

449
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,551
Officers, are you saying my friends

450
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:13,650
who took the trouble
of driving him here were...

451
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,560
- Did you hit something?
- It's old.

452
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,340
I think that's my dad's doing.

453
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,320
If you have any more information,

454
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,368
please don't hesitate to
come down to the station.

455
00:36:25,368 --> 00:36:28,130
- Of course.
- Excuse us for now.

456
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,720
Thank you.

457
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:44,200
Hey. You're back?

458
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,920
Let's eat.

459
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,390
Hello.

460
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,968
I believe we need to talk.

461
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,536
I want you to move out of Tulip's room.

462
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,432
I understand your trouble.

463
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,410
But ever since you're in the picture,
Tulip's changed.

464
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,140
She's against both me and her dad.

465
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,390
She even blocked his number.

466
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,816
Tulip is not a rebellious child.

467
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:27,610
What does that have to do with me?

468
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:31,020
Isn't that your family issue?

469
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:38,310
Even so, I think you're a bad influence
on Tulip and made her act like this.

470
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:43,000
And I don't want you to live here anymore.

471
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,936
I understand.

472
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,616
I'm okay moving out.

473
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:59,110
I am and will leave immediately,
if you think it will solve anything.

474
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,160
What are you saying?

475
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,736
Well...

476
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,648
Let's see,

477
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,448
did you raise Tulip all by yourself?

478
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,940
I'm just wondering how well
you know your own daughter.

479
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,544
She's a grown woman now.

480
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:23,368
She... needs her own space.

481
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,560
She has secrets.

482
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,720
Quite a lot, really.

483
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:35,752
I don't actually want to say this out loud,
but if Tulip doesn't have me,

484
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:41,460
she could likely have been in a worse place.

485
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,340
What did she do?

486
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,976
I'm not sure you know this friend of hers...

487
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:49,780
Tulip has a friend.

488
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,080
Quite a troublemaker, really.

489
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,860
If I wasn't there to save her that day,
let's say...

490
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,456
you could have been a grandmother.

491
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:03,561
I know my daughter well enough.

492
00:39:03,561 --> 00:39:06,041
Well, do you know she's dating someone?

493
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:09,970
- When?
- See?

494
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,670
She's keeping that from you.

495
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,904
You sure you really know your daughter?

496
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,760
Do you know what she's like
when you turn your back?

497
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,408
I don't mind showing you, you know.

498
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,680
I can't guarantee
you won't be surprised, though.

499
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,568
Don't panic and take your time watching.

500
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,720
Just admit it.

501
00:40:14,432 --> 00:40:17,230
You don't know your daughter...

502
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,544
like I do.

503
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,460
Mom?

504
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,504
What are you doing here?

505
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:49,470
It's probably my fault
for trusting you too much.

506
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,300
Now it's like I don't know you at all.

507
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,640
What are you talking about?

508
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,930
You're not allowed to live here anymore.

509
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,464
Pack your things and come home.

510
00:40:59,464 --> 00:41:01,024
Apologize to your father.

511
00:41:01,024 --> 00:41:02,420
What?

512
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,048
No!

513
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:06,456
Why should I do that?

514
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,752
Don't you know what you did?

515
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:15,550
How could you just be like that with a man?

516
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,640
How... did you know that?

517
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,752
I didn't want to be a conservative mother,

518
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,880
but what you did was too much, Tulip.

519
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:30,736
You're still using my money.

520
00:41:30,736 --> 00:41:33,490
You need to listen to me.

521
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,856
Pack your things and come home.

522
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:37,536
From now on, you report to me

523
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,440
whatever you do and where you go.

524
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,968
No. I'm not going.

525
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:44,870
You can't control my whole life.

526
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,820
Tulip.

527
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,040
Mom. I'm an adult.

528
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,616
I didn't do anything wrong.

529
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:52,312
I'm just in love.

530
00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:53,830
I have a boyfriend.

531
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,980
Just like everybody.

532
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,008
Come home!

533
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,380
No.

534
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,248
You can't keep telling me what to do.

535
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,770
If you don't come home,

536
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,380
I'm no longer giving you any money.

537
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,056
We'll see if you'll survive.

538
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,792
I don't know how Mom found out
about you and me.

539
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,060
But I'm so sad right now.

540
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,168
She wasn't even trying to understand.

541
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,144
She always lets dad off the hook.

542
00:42:50,144 --> 00:42:55,060
But with me,
she doesn't care about me at all, Tao.

543
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:59,216
I'm sure that's not the case.
She's just angry right now.

544
00:42:59,216 --> 00:43:04,280
Wait until she's calmed down,
and she will come around.

545
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,464
It's like they totally cut me off.

546
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:14,530
I honestly have no one left.

547
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,152
It's not that you have no one left.

548
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:28,700
You're just made to feel that way.

549
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,010
Will you wait for me here? I'll be back.

550
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,090
Where are you going?

551
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,072
There's something I need to do.

552
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:02,752
Come meet me. We need to talk.

553
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,184
Fine. Same place.

554
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,824
I promise everything will be alright.

555
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,536
I'll be back.

556
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,086
[20 ft to your right]

557
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,028
[Low Battery]

558
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:31,470
Baikhaw.

559
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:33,950
I'm begging you.

560
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,368
Stop hurting Tulip.

561
00:46:35,368 --> 00:46:37,328
You really like her, don't you?

562
00:46:38,744 --> 00:46:40,510
Yes, I do.

563
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,368
I like her.

564
00:46:44,184 --> 00:46:46,450
You freaking idiot.

565
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:51,440
You think she'd still take you if she knew
you hit Namo with your car?

566
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,940
I don't know!

567
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,844
I just know that
I don't want to hurt her anymore.

568
00:46:58,844 --> 00:47:00,692
I don't believe you!

569
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:06,145
I know you. You're still in love with me.

570
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,384
You still love me, don't you?

571
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,192
Hey. Let me explain.

572
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:06,400
What is there to explain?

573
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,456
You two are amazing.

574
00:48:08,456 --> 00:48:10,456
You made sure I have no one left in my life,

575
00:48:10,456 --> 00:48:11,944
but you two.

576
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:14,736
And now you betrayed me!

577
00:48:14,736 --> 00:48:19,130
I'm really sorry for not trusting you.

578
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,000
- I love you, Tulip.
- Go home.

579
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,640
Don't make me hate you more than
I already do.

580
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,089
Tulip will never forgive me now.

581
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:25,472
What did you do to make her suspicious?

582
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:26,648
- Baikhaw, you bitch!
- What?

583
00:48:26,648 --> 00:48:28,408
You deserve to be alone!

584
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:29,688
- My child!
- Mom!

585
00:48:29,688 --> 00:48:32,740
- My child!
- Mom, your child is dead!
