1
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:34,908
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:38,829
EPISODE 4

3
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:44,376
WITNESS

4
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:03,687
You may take the call.

5
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,745
DEFENDANT

6
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:39,348
Hello?

7
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:44,478
Hello?

8
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,024
Nice to meet you

9
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:58,158
Ms. Kim Ga-yeong.

10
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,336
PROSECUTOR

11
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:41,076
Password, please.

12
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,376
I guess he's taking it all the way.

13
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,336
I guess so.

14
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:54,756
All photos on Ms. Kim Ga-yeong's phone are

15
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,175
subject to confiscation.

16
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,467
As they are key evidence

17
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,761
for Defendant Park Hyeok-jun's case

18
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,305
we will unlock the phone

19
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:04,016
even without your permit, ex officio.

20
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,392
Ms. Kim

21
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:07,436
why don't you cooperate with the court?

22
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,235
Ms. Kim?

23
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,297
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

24
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,394
No way.

25
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,189
- What?
- Are they dating?

26
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:53,982
- What are they doing?
- Unbelievable!

27
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:06,912
Please!

28
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:08,747
Please.

29
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:10,415
Please...

30
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,293
Can you please not show that photo?

31
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:15,379
Please.

32
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:17,839
Come on!

33
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,306
DEFENDANT

34
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:29,476
Yeah.

35
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,480
It's all my fault.

36
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:39,695
Hey, Seon-hui!

37
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:41,071
Hey, Ga-yeong.

38
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,158
Hyeok-jun, say hi.

39
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,536
She's my closest cousin.

40
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:49,621
I promised

41
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:51,957
to show my boyfriend to her first
when I got one.

42
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,084
I kept my promise, okay?

43
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,544
Right on. Thanks.

44
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,256
Before Seon-hui came into the picture...

45
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,383
I'm Kim Seon-hui.

46
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:03,343
Hello, I'm Park Hyeok-jun.

47
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:05,762
our relationship was perfect.

48
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:11,268
No way. Really?

49
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,728
For real.

50
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:14,813
Okay, fine. Cheers.

51
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:26,366
I shouldn't have done that.

52
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,705
Should I tell Ga-yeong?

53
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:32,956
No, you can't do that.

54
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,583
I'll leave you to tell her.

55
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,878
I want a wedding
before my baby bump grows.

56
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:41,256
Hyeok-jun

57
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,175
why are you suddenly doing this?

58
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,177
Why are you doing this to me?

59
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:48,388
How could you do this to me?

60
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:53,894
At least tell me
why you suddenly want to break up.

61
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:55,062
But

62
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:57,981
Seon-hui wasn't pregnant.

63
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,275
She faked a positive pregnancy test

64
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,320
to make sure
I didn't choose Ga-yeong over her!

65
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:06,406
When I realized Seon-hui lied to me

66
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:09,910
I felt so betrayed

67
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,581
that I called Ga-yeong again.

68
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,041
And

69
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,380
I secretly got back with Ga-yeong
without Seon-hui's knowledge.

70
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,972
So, he didn't murder her for money

71
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:33,225
but for his complicated relationships?

72
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:40,107
Doesn't it seem like Judge Lee knew it all
from the start?

73
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:43,318
Yes.

74
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,988
It felt like he knew how it'd go
before even starting the trial.

75
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,409
I'm glad I came.

76
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:54,538
But isn't he already on Yi-seok's side?

77
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,290
I'll look into it.

78
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:02,254
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

79
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:30,866
I hope Sin-jin

80
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,618
enjoyed this trial.

81
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,413
IT WASN'T JUST AN INSURANCE FRAUD
BUT MESSY ROMANCE

82
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:37,873
DEFENDANT CONFESSES EVERYTHING

83
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,207
THE RINGING CELLPHONE SETTLED IT ALL

84
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,002
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE DEAD BRIDE-TO-BE

85
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,962
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG SOLVES
ANOTHER MURDER CASE

86
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:47,674
SEEING THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS
AND FINDING THE TRUTH

87
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,569
It didn't take long
for Seon-hui to find out

88
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,863
about Hyeok-jun getting back
with Ga-yeong.

89
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,873
And all the betrayal and jealousy ended

90
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,417
with murder.

91
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:46,191
I'd known Seon-hui for so long

92
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:48,985
but I guess I didn't know
everything about her.

93
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:55,200
You suspected something
between the two from the start, right?

94
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,869
Do you know her cousin

95
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,287
Ms. Kim Ga-yeong, then?

96
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,374
Yeah, I do. We all hung out with Seon-hui.

97
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:04,334
Do you know her personal phone number?

98
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,378
Not her work number on her business card.

99
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,296
Yes, I do.

100
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,549
I got her number
when we hung out with Seon-hui.

101
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:12,926
The police investigate the case

102
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:14,886
but judges examine records and evidence.

103
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,223
Often, when we puzzle the pieces together

104
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,016
the hidden truth shows itself.

105
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,104
I don't get it.

106
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,065
Don't you want to know
why I pretended to be a detective?

107
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:30,193
No, it's fine.

108
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:34,447
Come to think of it,
you never said you were a detective.

109
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:37,742
I just jumped to the conclusion
that you were.

110
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,953
My intuition is so off.

111
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:43,540
You played a huge part in this trial.

112
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:46,543
If I can help you in any way,
let me know anytime.

113
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:51,798
I feel so powerful
with a judge having my back.

114
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:56,094
Oh, I should get going.

115
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,178
Okay.

116
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:13,236
All three involved in Kim Seon-hui's case
were victims and accomplices.

117
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:16,031
Blinded by jealousy and greed

118
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:18,408
they did each other dirty

119
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:21,244
and left themselves in agony.

120
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:23,246
A TRAGIC STORY OF JEALOUSY AND GREED

121
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,998
A CLOSED MURDER CASE
INVOLVING A LOVER AND FAMILY

122
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:27,917
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

123
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:40,013
That was a good trial today.

124
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:45,060
Since it's a different type of case now,
it'll have bench trials.

125
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,897
Do you want to take it to the end
this time as well?

126
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:51,650
No, sir. I can't do that every time.

127
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,234
Okay.

128
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:58,823
Both cases will escalate
to the Supreme Court.

129
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:01,326
And by the time
they reach the Supreme Court

130
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:03,161
I would've become a Justice.

131
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:05,664
They're doing
an internal investigation on him.

132
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:07,707
It's a part of becoming a Justice.

133
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,751
Choose one you feel more confident about

134
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,378
and write the verdict.

135
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:14,172
I need that for whenever I boast to others

136
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:15,590
about having trained you here.

137
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,887
The Judiciary will be caught
in heavy restructuring soon

138
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,263
and the new Justice, Yi-seok

139
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,474
will resign soon after that,
unable to keep up.

140
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,644
If I leave him to become the Justice,
he'll be at risk.

141
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,146
I'd like to focus
on hands-on practice for now.

142
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,194
Is that so?

143
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:40,532
I was going to move you to Seoul
once I became the Justice.

144
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,742
- Hey.
- Sorry, sir.

145
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,078
I'm not ready for that yet.

146
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,255
To strike Sin-jin and Tae-sik

147
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:56,464
I'm going to need Yi-seok.

148
00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:00,093
I have to stop Yi-seok
from becoming the Justice.

149
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:08,059
Han-young!

150
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:20,572
What?

151
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:21,948
Did he come in?

152
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:32,876
What's wrong with you?

153
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,502
I like being in court.

154
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,379
You think you're quite the star?

155
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,506
You're so unbelievably cocky.

156
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,468
Well, I still have
a lot to learn from you.

157
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:42,552
Whatever.

158
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,389
Mr. Baek told me to do you a favor,
no questions asked.

159
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:50,435
Man, I don't even get why he likes you.

160
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:52,187
Bye, then.

161
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,521
Gosh, my back.

162
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,533
Why would you crawl under your desk?

163
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:09,871
Yes, Ms. Song.

164
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:12,248
Judge Lee

165
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:16,085
you told me to call you
whenever I needed your help, right?

166
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:17,837
You need me already?

167
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,340
Well, here's the thing.

168
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:24,010
My father is a security guard
at Gangcheon Palace

169
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:27,096
and he's being accused for theft.

170
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,724
We need to take legal action right now

171
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,893
but I don't know anything about that.

172
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:34,687
But a judge isn't allowed to be

173
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:36,523
a private legal counsel, though.

174
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,949
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

175
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:47,116
Hello.

176
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:51,079
What?

177
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,206
What did you just say?

178
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:55,333
What did you lose?

179
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:59,712
Don't be like that. Please help me.

180
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:04,467
I can't be your legal counsel,
but I can listen.

181
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,969
Exactly!

182
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,389
So, your father works at Gangcheon Palace?

183
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:12,392
Yes, the high-rise complex in Gangnam.

184
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:19,816
Wait, didn't that incident happen
around this time?

185
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,986
Do you know whose house was robbed?

186
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,321
The Director of Hanguk Hospital.

187
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:28,116
What happened exactly? Tell me straight.

188
00:14:29,784 --> 00:14:31,578
Well, I found out

189
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:34,873
only after I got home from work
last night.

190
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:46,551
Director Lee Chang-hyo of Hanguk Hospital.

191
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,636
If I play my cards right on this case

192
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,264
I can stop Yi-seok
from becoming a Justice.

193
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:56,144
Don't you realize what'll happen
if the world finds out?

194
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,611
When was the account book last updated?

195
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:09,032
The copy I sent you on the flash drive was
the latest version.

196
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:23,463
Mr. Kang.

197
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:25,423
Is something wrong?

198
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,221
VICTIMS SUE THE NAMMYEON DISTRICT OFFICE

199
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:34,766
How did Ha-na manage to get this case?

200
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:40,313
If she wins this case,
she's going to gloat over it forever.

201
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:41,648
Man, that sucks.

202
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:43,775
I can't stand her!

203
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,575
My gosh!

204
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:55,411
Are you just going to sit
and watch Ha-na do her thing?

205
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,622
What? The Nammyeon District sinkhole case?

206
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,123
I guess you're not a total moron.

207
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,465
NAMMYEON DISTRICT MAYOR ADMITS
HIS ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SINKHOLE CASE

208
00:16:07,548 --> 00:16:09,258
BUT REFUSES TO ADMIT
THAT THE DISTRICT IS AT FAULT

209
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,428
He's right.

210
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:15,723
No.

211
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:19,394
The District Mayor is saying
he's not responsible.

212
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:22,230
"Sorry that it happened,
but it wasn't our fault."

213
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:23,314
That's the gist, right?

214
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:24,649
If Mayor Chu wins this case

215
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:27,568
everyone will know Haenal
as "the evil law firm."

216
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,779
It'll hurt the firm's reputation

217
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,156
and we won't get big cases for a while.

218
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,575
And if we lose,
we blame Ha-na for her incompetence?

219
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:36,744
I guess you're not a moron, either.

220
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:38,371
Damn it.

221
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:42,041
What was Dad thinking
when he told her to take the case?

222
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,294
He's always curious
about how good his kids can be.

223
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,464
But you should focus
on the blind-date judge guy.

224
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:52,218
I hear he's pretty skilled
for a small college graduate.

225
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:55,847
You know very well
why Dad wants him as his son-in-law.

226
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,931
No, I don't.

227
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,766
I don't like him.

228
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:01,477
Think about it carefully.

229
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:03,438
It's your chance to keep your office here.

230
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:05,148
You're not even a licensed attorney.

231
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:06,607
I don't need to be one.

232
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:08,401
Once I become the owner of Haenal

233
00:17:08,484 --> 00:17:09,861
I'll be above them all, anyway.

234
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,990
My baby sister can be so ambitious.

235
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:15,825
But it's too bad.

236
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,828
Article 34 of the Attorney-at-Law Act.

237
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:19,912
"No person who is not an attorney-at-law"

238
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:22,081
"shall establish or operate a law office
by employing an attorney-at-law."

239
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:23,958
And you realize that this firm is

240
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,128
a law office, right?

241
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:30,757
I'll just choose an attorney
as a Firm Partner

242
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:33,718
and make them do as I say.

243
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,762
Consider getting on my good side.

244
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:39,015
Maybe I'll get you
a fancy Partner business card, too.

245
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,601
That's also illegal.

246
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:43,978
Haenal can defend me in court, then.

247
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,908
WOMAN SLAPPING HER DATE, WHO'S A JUDGE

248
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,244
- Whoa.
- Get out.

249
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,334
What a jerk.

250
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:08,211
WOMAN SLAPPING HER DATE, WHO'S A JUDGE

251
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:11,756
Thinks he's all that.

252
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,716
I know what favor I want to ask you.

253
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,511
I need to take some days off
from today until Friday.

254
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,054
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE LIM JEONG-SIK

255
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:19,222
What a guy.

256
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:22,975
That's random.

257
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:25,603
Oh! He must be hitting it off

258
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:27,563
with Haenal Law Firm's daughter.

259
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:29,023
Hilarious.

260
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:39,242
HONEY, SORRY FOR BEING A BAD HUSBAND
AND CAUSING YOU SO MUCH PAIN. GOODBYE...

261
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,789
Help...

262
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:50,169
JUNE 4, 2025, HAN JUN-YEONG

263
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,923
Please.

264
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,510
Please let me just call Sin-jin once!

265
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,470
Damn it!

266
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,809
NUMBER ONE

267
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:09,522
Yes.

268
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:10,940
I need you to find something.

269
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,734
From Unit 1204 of Gancheon Palace
in Gangnam.

270
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:16,237
Director Lee of Hanguk Hospital's house.

271
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,364
I don't care about anything else.

272
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,117
It's an account book.
You just need to get that.

273
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:23,619
Be sure to stay low.

274
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,121
Yes, sir.

275
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:27,498
Updates on Attorney Han's account number?

276
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:29,709
Mr. Kang!

277
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:32,336
I'm so sorry.

278
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:37,133
Please, just don't kill me!

279
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,552
I got it.

280
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:42,054
Time to wrap it up, then.

281
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:45,099
Yes, sir.

282
00:19:46,976 --> 00:19:48,144
Why are you hanging up?

283
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,354
Let me speak to him!

284
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,148
What did he say?

285
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,401
I told you my bank account number!

286
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:57,987
Did you tell him that?

287
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,614
Will he forgive me?

288
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:04,994
He would've forgiven you.
He's a very understanding guy.

289
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,581
Really?

290
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,918
Let me go already, then!

291
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:15,171
But just because he forgives you

292
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,798
doesn't mean he has to spare your life.

293
00:20:20,676 --> 00:20:21,719
That's the end.

294
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:24,055
What? What do you mean?

295
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:28,476
No, don't do it! Stop!

296
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,228
What the hell are you doing? No!

297
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,773
We found the account.

298
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,316
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

299
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:40,696
I knew he was delusional

300
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,615
for believing he brought success to Haenal

301
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:45,201
but I didn't expect him
to have taken commission.

302
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,537
But it's fine now, right?

303
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,169
MY WILL

304
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:57,171
JUNE 4, 2025, HAN JUN-YEONG

305
00:20:57,505 --> 00:20:59,131
There's even a handwritten will

306
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,092
so there shouldn't be any issues.

307
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,094
Does the missing book have

308
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:05,721
Justice Kim Jun-man's son's name in it?

309
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,394
It might get in the way
of his appointment as the Chief Justice.

310
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:13,854
Should I pull some strings
with the police?

311
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,690
Let's wait for now.

312
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:19,235
The world can't see the account book

313
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:23,447
for this file to do me any good.

314
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:34,667
CHUNGCHEONGNAM-DO, THE HOME OF BIG HEARTS

315
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:42,591
DELIVERY SERVICE

316
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,569
Where are you? I'm by the front gate.

317
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:10,619
Judge Lee!

318
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,883
You're wasting both of our time.

319
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:26,761
Return everything you've taken
before I take action.

320
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,889
Come on, Mr. Song!
You're being ridiculous!

321
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:31,640
Hey, bring me a stick.

322
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:33,267
Hold it tightly.

323
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:34,685
It's going to hurt.

324
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:35,811
Dad!

325
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,313
Get out!

326
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:38,397
Dad!

327
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:39,815
- Na-yeon!
- Are you okay?

328
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:41,734
Hey, lady.

329
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:44,653
Your dad is fine. We aren't.

330
00:22:44,987 --> 00:22:46,572
Did you know your dad was a thief?

331
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:49,283
No, there's no way.

332
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,827
Have you checked the surveillance cameras?

333
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,996
Those are for lower-class people.

334
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,707
The higher-ups despise
surveillance cameras.

335
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,835
- They're all very private.
- You should leave.

336
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,545
I'll sort it out and go. Hurry!

337
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:02,797
No!

338
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:04,548
Alright, then.

339
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:07,468
We'll need to keep your pretty daughter

340
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:10,513
until you bring back

341
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:12,139
what you've stolen.

342
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:13,557
Let's call it

343
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:14,975
a collateral.

344
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:18,562
This is unlawful confinement.

345
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,689
Yeah, I know. I do it all the time.

346
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,025
You're so pretty.

347
00:23:27,154 --> 00:23:28,447
There was a case

348
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:29,907
where the court ruled

349
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,034
that the strata management wasn't liable

350
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:33,828
for the theft of a resident's valuables

351
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,329
while they were away on a trip.

352
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:38,958
So, the resident's claim for damages

353
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,251
was dismissed.

354
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:41,585
What the hell is that?

355
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:43,254
- As per the security service contract
- As per the security service contract

356
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:44,547
- the resident was supposed
- the resident was supposed

357
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,923
- to have reported all valuables
- to have reported all valuables

358
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:48,092
- to the security guard in advance
- to the security guard in advance

359
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:50,719
- which they didn't do.
- which they didn't do.

360
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,721
What the hell?

361
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:55,558
What the hell is this bitch saying?

362
00:23:57,518 --> 00:23:58,519
Dad

363
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,312
did the resident notify you

364
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,940
that he had valuables at his home
before going on that trip?

365
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:06,819
Who would notify their security guards
like that?

366
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:11,449
Gangcheon Palace has a disclaimer,
stating that it isn't responsible

367
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:12,783
- for any lost belongings
- For any lost belongings

368
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:14,910
- that the resident didn't notify them...
- that the resident didn't notify them

369
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:16,787
in advance.

370
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:19,331
Seriously, what are you?

371
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,085
A lawyer?

372
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:24,920
No.

373
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:28,632
I'm a reporter for Daejin Daily.

374
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:30,009
Oh.

375
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:33,387
And everything that's been said

376
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:36,682
has been recorded right here.

377
00:24:36,765 --> 00:24:39,101
All the sexual harassment and threats!

378
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:40,811
Damn.

379
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:42,730
You should've thought it through

380
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:44,440
before telling me about that evidence.

381
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:45,983
- Hand it over.
- No.

382
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,319
- No!
- Na-yeon!

383
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:52,740
Piss off!

384
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:53,866
Hey, that's my phone!

385
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:56,160
No wonder the call got disconnected.

386
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:57,244
Huh?

387
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:00,206
What are you guys doing here?

388
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:02,041
- What? Who are you?
- Excuse me.

389
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:03,501
Excuse me.

390
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:05,711
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Who are you?

391
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:08,672
Isn't this expensive?

392
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:10,257
Yes, what do I do?

393
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:11,926
I'm still paying for it monthly!

394
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:14,011
- It's all smashed.
- Am I invisible to you?

395
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:15,763
Are you ignoring me?

396
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:17,181
Who the hell are you?

397
00:25:17,264 --> 00:25:18,474
Are you a reporter, too?

398
00:25:19,016 --> 00:25:21,435
You're too young
to be talking like that to me.

399
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:24,396
What?

400
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:28,734
What, you're an old soul inside?

401
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:29,860
Hey

402
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:31,737
get moving already!

403
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,739
No, wait.

404
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:38,661
Article 366 of the Criminal Act
on Destruction and Damage of Property.

405
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,622
A person who, by destroying, damaging

406
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:44,166
or concealing another's property document
or special media records

407
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,252
such as electromagnetic records, etc.

408
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,962
shall be punished by imprisonment
for not more than three years

409
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:49,755
or by a fine
not exceeding seven million won.

410
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:52,633
I'd recommend three years in jail, though.

411
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,009
Sure, sure.

412
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:56,428
You work really hard, huh?

413
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:58,597
I didn't know reporters memorized laws
these days.

414
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:01,684
You haven't lived long enough, huh?

415
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,269
You still think I'm a reporter?

416
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,065
What, then? You a lawyer?

417
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:11,986
Not a prosecutor, right? Sir?

418
00:26:12,695 --> 00:26:14,488
I'm sure you've been in court often.

419
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:15,948
You know how there are

420
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:17,575
prosecutors, attorneys, and one more?

421
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:18,909
In the highest seats.

422
00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:21,870
There can be
up to three of us.

423
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:23,497
If you're more familiar
with seeing three

424
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,207
you're really, really bad.

425
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,836
After all, bench trials are for murders,
robbery, and aggravated assault.

426
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:31,297
No, sir.

427
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,924
I usually only see one of you.

428
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:36,385
You want to sit?

429
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:37,845
- You can sit there.
- Yes, sir.

430
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,388
Everyone, take your seats.

431
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:41,265
Go ahead. Sit.

432
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,399
Within less than 30 minutes,
you guys have committed

433
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:52,901
unlawful confinement, damage to property

434
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,111
and assault.

435
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:56,780
How many years of imprisonment
you think that'll be in total?

436
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:58,240
You're curious, right?

437
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:00,409
But I'll tell you that later

438
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:01,744
in court.

439
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:02,828
Well...

440
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:05,205
There's only one code of law,
but I get to judge.

441
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:06,999
Let me explain it to you.

442
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:08,959
The moment you commit a crime

443
00:27:09,043 --> 00:27:11,170
your lives depend on what I say.

444
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:14,465
So, if you don't want to screw
your lives up

445
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:16,800
do everything at all costs to avoid me.

446
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:18,802
But

447
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:22,514
are you really a judge?

448
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:25,184
Is a judge allowed to be
so verbally forceful?

449
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:28,646
Why not? It sounds more legit,
coming from a judge.

450
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:31,649
Should I call a prosecutor

451
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:33,067
and start with a search?

452
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,985
Wow!

453
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:39,948
I'd love to see a face like yours
in court one day.

454
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:42,493
Don't be ridiculous.
We have our lawyer, too.

455
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:45,537
Threatening to arrest us

456
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:47,122
without any real charges is

457
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:48,791
illegal.

458
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,959
Oh, but it's too bad.

459
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:52,336
The judge also gets to decide

460
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:53,837
what's legal or not.

461
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:56,965
And I'm a judge.

462
00:27:57,841 --> 00:27:58,967
I'm a judge.

463
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:00,552
I'm a judge!

464
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:05,099
I'm a judge.

465
00:28:05,974 --> 00:28:07,768
Let's start with this.

466
00:28:17,736 --> 00:28:19,029
What if that bastard

467
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:20,989
isn't even a judge?

468
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:24,118
Should I drag him back?

469
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:25,494
You crazy?

470
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:32,084
- Careful, Dad.
- Okay.

471
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:35,921
- Oh? Hold on, Dad.
- Okay.

472
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:40,968
My gosh, Judge Lee!

473
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,596
You were so cool...

474
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,393
Anyway, you know you're an oddball, right?

475
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:53,439
Ta-da!

476
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:57,234
You can pay for your broken phone upfront

477
00:28:57,317 --> 00:28:58,736
and get a new one with this.

478
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,489
Anyway, you can't write an article
about this, okay?

479
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,993
It could get your dad
and the other security guards fired.

480
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:08,245
I know.

481
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,080
Thank you

482
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:11,957
for today.

483
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:15,753
Bye, then.

484
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,270
Stone Jeong-ho!

485
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:54,333
Hey, young Han-young!

486
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,084
Has the ride been smooth?

487
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:58,670
Me?

488
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:01,006
I'm on my way to work. Why?

489
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:03,926
SUNI'S SUNDAE SOUP RESTAURANT

490
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:14,394
Boss

491
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:17,105
may I also order some suyuk?

492
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:20,192
You can eat all the suyuk they have here.

493
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:22,110
Thank you!

494
00:30:22,194 --> 00:30:23,779
Hey, suyuk time!

495
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:31,870
Did those bastards starve for days

496
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:34,039
to have sundae soup and suyuk or what?

497
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:36,959
Seriously, I know you're broke

498
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:39,169
but why would you borrow money
from Jeong-ho?

499
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:41,296
Don't you know what he's like?

500
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,548
Gosh.

501
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:49,930
That's 20 bowls of sundae soup.

502
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:52,307
There were 8 of you.
You didn't have 20 bowls.

503
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:54,893
Look at how big they are.

504
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,478
Some had two bowls

505
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:57,980
and this guy had three.

506
00:30:58,063 --> 00:30:59,648
And...

507
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:01,275
Hey!

508
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,612
I told you not to drink while working.

509
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:09,908
I'm deducting the price of that soju
from your next paycheck.

510
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:12,536
Boss, does that mean

511
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:14,454
I can have one more bottle, then?

512
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:15,706
- Just one more?
- Yeah!

513
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:16,832
You want to die?

514
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:19,459
- You want to get fired?
- No, sir! I'm sorry, sir!

515
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:20,711
Forget it.

516
00:31:21,503 --> 00:31:25,048
We had 20 bowls of sundae soup,
which is 8,000 won each.

517
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:26,425
And the soju is

518
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:28,844
4,000 won per bottle.

519
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:32,097
As for the suyuk...

520
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:35,517
That's at least eight big plates.

521
00:31:38,437 --> 00:31:41,315
Okay, that's 280,000 won deducted
from what you borrowed.

522
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:42,399
- Deducted?
- Deducted?

523
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:44,401
Gosh, she's not making any money, then!

524
00:31:45,277 --> 00:31:47,029
How is she supposed to make a living?

525
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:48,113
Suni

526
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,783
you have until next month
to pay me 5,250,000 won.

527
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:54,411
Be on time, alright?

528
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,496
If not, watch me just...

529
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,874
bring every elderly person in town here.

530
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:03,045
Gosh.

531
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:04,755
Are you crazy?

532
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:07,758
If you keep deducting our debts
because we're struggling

533
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:09,635
you're going to go broke.

534
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,096
Hey, did Jeong-ho pay you the market price

535
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,515
for the cabbage and spinach at your shop?

536
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,684
Jeong-ho would never.

537
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,645
He paid full price for them

538
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:22,940
but sold them for half the price
or for nothing to charity.

539
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,984
I have to check Jeong-ho's back.

540
00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:27,819
He's got to have wings!

541
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,865
He basically grew up at the market

542
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,575
stuck right by his mom's side.

543
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,036
Gosh, our bratty little Jeong-ho.

544
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,120
It feels like yesterday

545
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:39,247
that he was begging his mom for 100 won.

546
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:41,416
He grew up to be such a fine man.

547
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,419
The market basically raised him, you know?

548
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:47,130
- For sure.
- So, sell more.

549
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,258
You need to sell more to earn more

550
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:51,718
then you can pay off your debt

551
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:53,261
and keep me from going broke.

552
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:58,183
Han-young!

553
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:00,102
Hey!

554
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,773
Guys, say hello.

555
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:07,818
This is my best friend,
Judge Lee Han-young.

556
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:09,736
Boss Judge!

557
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,071
- Hello!
- Hello!

558
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:12,614
Oh, hi, everyone.

559
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:15,951
I didn't see you bow.

560
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,204
Please support our local market.

561
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:20,580
Grocery chains are great

562
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,624
but we must keep our local markets afloat.

563
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,209
Please take this.

564
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:27,170
Please support our local market.
Thanks so much.

565
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:31,508
So, you give loans to the market people
and let them pay in food and goods?

566
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:33,593
And you donate the goods to those in need.

567
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:35,971
Those people have been feeding me

568
00:33:36,054 --> 00:33:38,098
and giving me allowances
since my diaper days.

569
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:39,933
Please check out our local market.

570
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,184
Thank you.

571
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:42,811
We love you.

572
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:44,688
What if you go broke?

573
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:46,940
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

574
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,191
- Go broke?
- Yeah.

575
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:49,317
Hey

576
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:52,070
I have 12 full-time employees.

577
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:53,447
They're fully insured

578
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,574
and I offer severance pay
and holiday bonuses.

579
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:57,617
Even then, I'm still going. How?

580
00:33:58,368 --> 00:34:00,120
Because I'm CEO Seok Jeong-ho.

581
00:34:03,915 --> 00:34:05,208
It's going up!

582
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:07,210
Nice, boss!

583
00:34:07,294 --> 00:34:09,588
ARCADE

584
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:13,467
Hello, sir.

585
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:15,719
LOTTERY SHOP

586
00:34:15,802 --> 00:34:16,845
Did I win first place?

587
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,222
Yes, you did!

588
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:25,270
- Everything good?
- Yes, sir.

589
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:31,234
KARAOKE

590
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:33,528
- Sorry.
- No!

591
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:35,113
I'm the owner.

592
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:36,406
I'll give you extra time.

593
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,576
CONVENIENCE STORE

594
00:34:40,118 --> 00:34:41,745
It's expiring at the end of the day.

595
00:34:41,828 --> 00:34:43,038
I'll take it if you don't want it.

596
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,124
Thank you, sir.

597
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:52,964
I don't just have a loan business.

598
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:55,217
I have four subsidiaries.

599
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,426
I won't ever go broke.

600
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:00,680
By the way

601
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:03,266
what is Your Honor doing in Seoul?

602
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,434
What are you doing?

603
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:08,939
Some thieves broke into Gangcheon Palace
in Gangnam.

604
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:11,316
But it's not about finding the thieves.

605
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:13,568
We need what they have taken.

606
00:35:15,153 --> 00:35:18,240
Clearly, the police can't find out
about it.

607
00:35:19,282 --> 00:35:20,450
That's none of my business.

608
00:35:22,828 --> 00:35:24,579
What if this causes you trouble?

609
00:35:24,996 --> 00:35:25,997
No.

610
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:27,999
I can't do it if it causes you trouble.

611
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,584
I refuse.

612
00:35:31,878 --> 00:35:33,088
It's fine.

613
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,341
It won't take long, then.

614
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:38,802
I know the robbers in Gangnam.

615
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:40,637
Sidekick!

616
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:46,601
Yes, boss.

617
00:35:46,685 --> 00:35:48,436
Find out who robbed Gangcheon Palace.

618
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,480
I'll pay you for it.

619
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:52,065
Yes, boss.

620
00:35:57,863 --> 00:35:59,614
What exactly are you looking for?

621
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:02,409
If the cops can't hear about it

622
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:05,787
and you've come to me instead of the cops

623
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:07,539
it has to be something real special.

624
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:08,665
It's an account book.

625
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,084
It's a long list of names.

626
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:13,753
And those people are real trouble,
I assume.

627
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,801
By the way

628
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:24,848
you're still not thinking
about that incident, right?

629
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,268
What incident?

630
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:32,772
Nothing.

631
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,357
I need to check on my shops.

632
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:35,442
I'll call you later.

633
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:37,944
Gosh.

634
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,160
I know

635
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:47,495
what you're worried about.

636
00:36:56,796 --> 00:36:58,798
I'm going to buy that. I called dibs.

637
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:00,175
No, I'm getting it.

638
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:02,719
I called dibs first. Get something else.

639
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:03,845
Do you even have money?

640
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:06,306
My dad gets paid tomorrow.

641
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:08,975
He buys me anything I ask for
on his payday.

642
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,352
How much does he make?

643
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:12,479
He makes millions of billions of won!

644
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:15,023
My dad makes billions of billions!

645
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:18,235
Han-young,
how much does your dad get paid?

646
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,112
Hey, his dad doesn't have a job.

647
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,531
Really?

648
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:31,748
You can't just leave like that.

649
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:36,044
You have to pay me back

650
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:38,046
and give me money for living expenses.

651
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,883
Am I not giving you money
because I'm hiding it?

652
00:37:42,968 --> 00:37:44,594
Just be a little patient.

653
00:37:44,678 --> 00:37:47,472
Mr. Hwang said he'd pay me
for all the overdue pay

654
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:49,724
if I joined him for his new business.

655
00:37:49,808 --> 00:37:51,226
And you believe him?

656
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:54,271
You keep getting scammed
because you trust too easily.

657
00:37:57,357 --> 00:37:58,984
You can't help him at all

658
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:01,486
until he pays you for what he owes you.

659
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:04,948
At least make him pay you
a month's salary first, okay?

660
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,658
Fine, fine.

661
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:09,077
I'll work harder.

662
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:12,372
Are you just coming back from school?

663
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:13,790
Yes, I'm back.

664
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:14,874
Okay.

665
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:17,419
- Dad.
- Yeah?

666
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:18,878
The stationery shop

667
00:38:19,212 --> 00:38:21,089
- has a...
- Han-young

668
00:38:21,548 --> 00:38:23,883
you have to study hard
and become a judge, okay?

669
00:38:28,763 --> 00:38:30,765
He works hard for nothing.

670
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,809
He's too gentle to stand up for himself.

671
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,481
The stationery shop?

672
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:40,442
You need school supplies?

673
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,864
Whenever my father saw me,
he told me to become a judge.

674
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:48,783
I hated hearing him say that

675
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,494
like it was a habit.

676
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:54,247
So, that day

677
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:57,167
I stole something.

678
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:00,712
Let us live!

679
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:02,839
- Let us live!
- Let us live!

680
00:39:02,922 --> 00:39:04,674
Out with S Construction!

681
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:06,634
- Out!
- Out!

682
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:08,887
Let us live!

683
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,264
- Let us live!
- Let us live!

684
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:12,474
Hey, Jeong-ho

685
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:14,017
should we just open a business?

686
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:15,977
This contract guard work is the same

687
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:17,520
as being in a gang, anyway.

688
00:39:17,604 --> 00:39:18,688
One day.

689
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:22,317
Out with S Construction!

690
00:39:34,245 --> 00:39:35,663
FIGHT

691
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:38,917
FIGHT

692
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:56,893
Are you okay?

693
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:05,485
Don't come here!

694
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:07,278
Father?

695
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:09,322
No!

696
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:16,204
Father!

697
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:18,415
Let's go, Han-young.

698
00:40:18,498 --> 00:40:20,417
- Hurry!
- Jeong-ho!

699
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,502
Look.

700
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:27,757
Hey, we have to run.

701
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,054
FIGHT

702
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:37,267
Everyone, please be seated.

703
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:46,443
We will commence the session
for Case 2007GH5432

704
00:40:46,526 --> 00:40:48,194
involving Defendant Lee Bong-seok

705
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:50,655
on his violation
of the Punishment of Violences Act

706
00:40:50,738 --> 00:40:53,158
in an incident
of a mass weaponized assault.

707
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:55,577
We are now in session.

708
00:40:56,578 --> 00:40:58,163
Defendant, please come in.

709
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:36,034
MAIN COURTROOMS 417, 418, 419

710
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:40,330
The verdict for Defendant Lee Bong-seok

711
00:41:40,413 --> 00:41:42,749
on his violation
of the Punishment of Violences Act

712
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:46,377
in an incident
of a mass weaponized assault is ready.

713
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:48,630
I hereby announce

714
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:53,551
that the Defendant used a weapon

715
00:41:53,968 --> 00:41:55,803
to cause fractures to the hired guards

716
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:58,932
in his conflict with them.

717
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:01,351
Hit in the head by a wooden baton

718
00:42:01,434 --> 00:42:03,645
my father passed out
as soon as the fight broke out.

719
00:42:03,728 --> 00:42:05,271
So, he denied his allegation

720
00:42:05,355 --> 00:42:07,023
but the Judiciary rejected his appeal.

721
00:42:07,106 --> 00:42:10,902
Furthermore, the witnesses' stories match

722
00:42:10,985 --> 00:42:14,614
and the Defendant was confirmed
to have fled the site.

723
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:16,407
The judge accepted the false claims

724
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,117
of the security company.

725
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,078
But in court

726
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:23,331
there was one witness
who could testify to his innocence.

727
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,794
The court hereby orders
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

728
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:31,506
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

729
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:35,468
The Defendant has one week to appeal

730
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:38,471
to the court's decision
from the day of the announcement.

731
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,473
If an appeal is not filed

732
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:43,726
the decision will be carried out
as announced.

733
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:51,442
And that was

734
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,487
me.

735
00:42:58,825 --> 00:43:01,286
But I couldn't say anything.

736
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:03,705
Because if I testified

737
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:07,292
I would've had to admit
that I left my father behind

738
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:09,627
to save myself.

739
00:43:22,682 --> 00:43:24,934
So, that became the second day
I abandoned my father.

740
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:26,936
But that was the day I decided

741
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,813
I'd become a judge, as he always wanted.

742
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:34,527
Because I thought

743
00:43:35,194 --> 00:43:37,614
if I became a judge

744
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,825
I could bring myself to ask him
if he saw me at the fight.

745
00:43:44,662 --> 00:43:45,663
But

746
00:43:46,122 --> 00:43:47,915
I never got to ask him.

747
00:43:51,502 --> 00:43:52,754
Because before I realized it

748
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:56,299
I'd become someone just like Jang Tae-sik.

749
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:04,807
Damn it.

750
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:09,145
Hey, are you crazy?

751
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:11,022
- Prosecutor Kim!
- Are you trying to die?

752
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:12,398
Hold up.

753
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:13,733
Please excuse me.

754
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:24,410
I'm Kim Jin-a of the Specialized Division
at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

755
00:44:24,786 --> 00:44:26,162
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

756
00:44:33,586 --> 00:44:35,922
I'm Kim Jin-a, a prosecutor
at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

757
00:44:38,091 --> 00:44:39,967
I didn't know prosecutors pulled

758
00:44:40,301 --> 00:44:42,261
insurance frauds these days.

759
00:44:43,137 --> 00:44:46,891
Mr. Jang, you're under emergency arrest
on charges of offshore tax evasion.

760
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:49,227
You have the right to an attorney

761
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,062
and a chance to explain yourself.

762
00:44:58,236 --> 00:44:59,404
You got a lighter?

763
00:45:01,155 --> 00:45:03,199
Whoa, Jang Tae-sik!

764
00:45:03,783 --> 00:45:05,493
Is he crazy?

765
00:45:05,576 --> 00:45:07,120
Hey! Get down right here.

766
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:08,746
- Detention?
- Please calm down.

767
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,997
Ten years?

768
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:11,207
Let go!

769
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:14,252
You have the right to request
a review of the legality of your arrest

770
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:15,962
and to remain silent.

771
00:45:20,174 --> 00:45:21,217
Let's go.

772
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:30,059
I hear you're always dying
to prosecute S Group.

773
00:45:30,143 --> 00:45:31,436
Is that your life's mission?

774
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,604
Or is it for personal vendetta?

775
00:45:35,314 --> 00:45:36,315
Both.

776
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:41,779
I went after Jang Tae-sik
as soon as I became a prosecutor.

777
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:49,162
Wow, wow, wow.

778
00:45:50,663 --> 00:45:53,624
Maybe I should've asked
what the revenge was for.

779
00:45:57,211 --> 00:46:00,298
We had no choice with the police starting
an internal investigation.

780
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:03,760
The emergency arrest calmed things
for now.

781
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:05,762
What should we do?

782
00:46:06,345 --> 00:46:07,805
Let's just wait.

783
00:46:09,182 --> 00:46:10,641
Yes, sir.

784
00:46:13,895 --> 00:46:16,230
S GROUP CHAIRMAN JANG YONG-HYEON

785
00:46:19,192 --> 00:46:20,401
It's me, Kang Sin-jin.

786
00:46:22,862 --> 00:46:25,823
The prosecution made an emergency arrest
of Mr. Jang Tae-sik.

787
00:46:26,282 --> 00:46:28,284
So, the police won't investigate it

788
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,495
but he must stay in custody for 48 hours.

789
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:34,123
To make the prosecution look good

790
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,751
and keep others from talking.

791
00:46:38,503 --> 00:46:39,587
Alright.

792
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,713
JANG YONG-HYEON, CHAIRMAN OF S GROUP

793
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,927
Let's follow the procedure

794
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,972
and go one by one.

795
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:04,028
Don't say anything,
and nothing will happen.

796
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:05,154
Alright.

797
00:47:05,905 --> 00:47:08,366
That's what you're here for.

798
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,331
Oh, my.

799
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:18,084
There you are, Prosecutor Kim.

800
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:21,087
REPORT ON S SHOPPING'S CHARGES
ON OFFSHORE TAX EVASION

801
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:25,883
Alright.

802
00:47:30,763 --> 00:47:32,223
GANG-GIL, DO NOT PICK UP

803
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,352
Let's begin.

804
00:47:36,435 --> 00:47:39,230
But you got a call.

805
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,858
If you don't pick it up

806
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:44,360
you'll get in trouble.

807
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:46,153
Lighter.

808
00:47:48,114 --> 00:47:49,240
Lighter!

809
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:52,118
It's been an hour now

810
00:47:52,201 --> 00:47:54,161
so you just have 47 more to go.

811
00:47:56,414 --> 00:47:57,915
Don't be so sure yet.

812
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:05,965
GANG-GIL, DON'T PICK UP

813
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:11,804
Yes, sir.

814
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:14,515
Come in.

815
00:48:21,188 --> 00:48:22,189
You'll receive files

816
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:24,400
about S Shopping's tax evasion
tomorrow morning.

817
00:48:25,818 --> 00:48:28,279
I already got the files
from the police investigation.

818
00:48:28,362 --> 00:48:29,864
No, not those.

819
00:48:30,448 --> 00:48:32,658
Just let Mr. Jang go to bed tonight

820
00:48:32,742 --> 00:48:34,201
and start when you get the files.

821
00:48:34,952 --> 00:48:35,953
Come on.

822
00:48:36,037 --> 00:48:38,372
We don't want them attacking us
for human rights abuse.

823
00:48:38,456 --> 00:48:40,833
CHIEF PROSECUTOR MA GANG-GIL

824
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,711
You can leave now.

825
00:48:48,215 --> 00:48:50,843
CHIEF PROSECUTOR MA GANG-GIL

826
00:48:53,512 --> 00:48:55,681
But you told me to make
an emergency arrest!

827
00:48:56,265 --> 00:48:57,433
What's with him now?

828
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,647
I have a feeling

829
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,232
this is going to be shit.

830
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:16,953
An emergency arrest was made
on CEO Jang of S Shopping

831
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:19,789
an hour ago.

832
00:49:19,872 --> 00:49:20,998
It's offshore tax evasion.

833
00:49:21,082 --> 00:49:22,166
Dad!

834
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:24,669
They made an emergency arrest
of CEO Jang of S Shopping!

835
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,880
Oh, you knew it already.

836
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:29,548
You, too?

837
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,301
Yeah, Father knew about it

838
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:34,011
but I didn't know
it was an emergency arrest.

839
00:49:34,095 --> 00:49:35,846
HAENAL LAW FIRM

840
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,598
What about his offshore tax evasion?

841
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:41,018
You can't run a law firm
just by being a good lawyer.

842
00:49:41,477 --> 00:49:43,479
You need good business skills, too.

843
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:47,566
I read the police investigation files.

844
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,776
I see.

845
00:49:52,697 --> 00:49:54,740
Why do you guys always get so serious
without me?

846
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:05,376
The police started investigating
S Shopping

847
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:07,878
for offshore tax evasion charges.

848
00:50:07,962 --> 00:50:10,673
The prosecution must've taken over
before it got more serious.

849
00:50:11,465 --> 00:50:14,176
It's an emergency arrest.
He'll be detained for 48 hours

850
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,388
then he'll be let go once they confirm
the tax evasion and his slush funds.

851
00:50:18,389 --> 00:50:19,765
And all media outlets will have

852
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:22,143
S Department Store and S Mart ads
all over for a while.

853
00:50:23,352 --> 00:50:25,021
What's the point of knowing it all?

854
00:50:25,104 --> 00:50:26,772
None of this is beneficial for us.

855
00:50:29,191 --> 00:50:30,192
Dad

856
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:32,403
I think we're going to win

857
00:50:32,486 --> 00:50:33,988
in CQR Group's merger case.

858
00:50:35,448 --> 00:50:37,825
The judge is now on our side.

859
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:43,080
With all the evidence
and the shareholders' testimonies

860
00:50:43,164 --> 00:50:44,707
we see some hope now.

861
00:50:49,336 --> 00:50:51,130
Whether we flip the coin

862
00:50:52,298 --> 00:50:53,591
or set it straight

863
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:56,844
doesn't it entirely depend
on whose hand it's in?

864
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:04,769
It's the same in court.

865
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:11,442
Okay, keep up the good work until the end.

866
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:13,402
Okay.

867
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:16,906
Se-hee, how are things going
with that judge?

868
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,161
You know.

869
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:24,038
I didn't set up that date
to entertain you!

870
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:25,289
Do you know what I mean?

871
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:29,960
Yes, I hear you.

872
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:35,549
Ha-na, is the Nammyeon-gu sinkhole case
going well?

873
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:38,344
Yes, Father, don't worry.

874
00:51:42,515 --> 00:51:45,684
They're always busy talking about the firm
whenever I'm not around.

875
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:48,854
Just wait and see.

876
00:51:49,313 --> 00:51:50,898
Whatever in the Judiciary you are

877
00:51:50,981 --> 00:51:53,359
I'll trample over all of you.

878
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:56,779
Just don't beg me for mercy then.

879
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:01,909
Man, why hasn't he called me yet?

880
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,082
Or do I look desperate
to catch a rich lady?

881
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:13,045
That's it? He makes that one comment
and ghosts me?

882
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,177
He's definitely a player.

883
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,639
HAENAL LAW FIRM

884
00:52:23,722 --> 00:52:26,392
No updates from the sinkhole victims yet?

885
00:52:27,768 --> 00:52:28,936
And the district office?

886
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:32,982
S Shopping is currently denying

887
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:35,109
all allegations of accounting fraud

888
00:52:35,192 --> 00:52:36,610
CEO Jang's offshore tax evasion

889
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:39,029
and slush funds.

890
00:52:39,446 --> 00:52:40,906
S Shopping announced

891
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,325
- Isn't that him?
- that nothing was illegal in management

892
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:45,619
- Huh?
- and that all accounting...

893
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:47,329
Who's "him"?

894
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:49,707
The guy who locked me up in jail

895
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,835
and threatened to make me go bankrupt
with the settlement.

896
00:52:54,128 --> 00:52:56,505
He was the CEO of the construction company

897
00:52:56,589 --> 00:52:58,340
but now, he runs a department store.

898
00:52:59,383 --> 00:53:00,968
Nothing's changed.

899
00:53:01,552 --> 00:53:03,596
The rich are still corrupt.

900
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:06,891
I'm sure he'll live just fine,
even after committing all those crimes.

901
00:53:06,974 --> 00:53:09,226
First, they allegedly set up
an overseas paper company

902
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:12,062
and forged a contract
with S Shopping's affiliate...

903
00:53:15,691 --> 00:53:19,195
I didn't know he threatened my father
with the settlement payment.

904
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:22,990
I bet he evicted everyone that way.

905
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:39,048
Mr. Jang, you're under emergency arrest
on charges of offshore tax evasion.

906
00:53:39,131 --> 00:53:40,758
We could do so much

907
00:53:40,841 --> 00:53:42,968
if we became a team.

908
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:57,441
SAME-DAY LOANS AVAILABLE

909
00:53:57,524 --> 00:53:59,443
ALL CASH FOR YOU

910
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:05,950
- Hey, sidekick.
- Hi, boss.

911
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:08,577
This guy, "Open Sesame,"
got out of jail this year

912
00:54:08,661 --> 00:54:11,580
and rumors say he pulled a big one
with his restaurant buddies.

913
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:12,665
Okay!

914
00:54:13,332 --> 00:54:14,375
Good work.

915
00:54:33,644 --> 00:54:34,812
Jjajangmyeon delivery.

916
00:54:38,023 --> 00:54:39,316
DELIVERY

917
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:57,459
Come to Room 903 at Edge Motel.

918
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,628
We should be able to destroy the stuff.

919
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,356
The thing is at Open Sesame's house.

920
00:55:19,648 --> 00:55:21,150
We took care of the entrance

921
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:23,444
and Open Sesame was in charge of the safe.

922
00:55:23,777 --> 00:55:25,654
There should've been an account book

923
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:28,407
among what you've stolen.

924
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:30,701
Account book...

925
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:42,755
Hey, take everything out.

926
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:44,465
Take it all.

927
00:55:45,883 --> 00:55:47,176
Yes, there was.

928
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:49,845
Oh, but that...

929
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:00,439
It's all in here.

930
00:56:09,448 --> 00:56:10,741
I hear they call you "Open Sesame."

931
00:56:10,824 --> 00:56:12,910
- Yes.
- Guess what they call me.

932
00:56:15,412 --> 00:56:16,413
Bear?

933
00:56:16,497 --> 00:56:17,956
Teddy.

934
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:19,792
Grizzly.

935
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:21,585
Teddy bear!

936
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,420
What do they call you?

937
00:56:24,338 --> 00:56:25,631
People call me

938
00:56:26,423 --> 00:56:27,591
an angel.

939
00:56:27,674 --> 00:56:29,718
- Why?
- When I get mad...

940
00:56:30,344 --> 00:56:31,512
Move over.

941
00:56:33,305 --> 00:56:35,516
I send them to heaven with one blow.

942
00:56:37,017 --> 00:56:39,103
What do you say, Open Sesame?

943
00:56:39,812 --> 00:56:40,813
You want to go?

944
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:42,356
No, sorry!

945
00:56:42,689 --> 00:56:44,066
Why would you lie, then?

946
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:46,860
I don't see

947
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:49,988
what my friend is looking for here.

948
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:52,950
What is it?

949
00:56:58,539 --> 00:56:59,665
What is this?

950
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,792
Why did you even bring it?

951
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:02,960
You told me to take everything.

952
00:57:03,043 --> 00:57:05,254
- Just chuck it.
- Okay, let's go already.

953
00:57:22,396 --> 00:57:23,397
Oh, gosh.

954
00:57:23,772 --> 00:57:26,775
I collected so much today.

955
00:57:28,569 --> 00:57:29,736
Oh, gosh.

956
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:33,991
Over there!

957
00:57:34,491 --> 00:57:35,534
Right there.

958
00:57:49,965 --> 00:57:51,258
What does the book look like?

959
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:54,261
It had a black cover with a coil.

960
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,972
Hey, don't touch that! Young!

961
00:57:57,055 --> 00:57:58,515
- Hey.
- Step aside!

962
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:04,396
I definitely chucked it here.

963
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,361
Hey, I'll send you an address.

964
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:13,864
Gather everyone
aside from those running the shops.

965
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,241
Here...

966
00:58:19,745 --> 00:58:21,705
A lot of elders collect scraps
in the area.

967
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:27,002
- Hello, boss!
- Hello, boss!

968
00:58:27,085 --> 00:58:28,086
Hey.

969
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:33,383
We'll begin

970
00:58:33,467 --> 00:58:36,094
a search for a coiled notebook
with a black cover now.

971
00:58:36,178 --> 00:58:39,056
Check the scrap-collecting elders
and nearby junkyards first.

972
00:58:39,139 --> 00:58:41,141
Be as polite and efficient as possible.

973
00:58:41,225 --> 00:58:42,226
Get on it.

974
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:43,310
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

975
00:58:43,393 --> 00:58:45,103
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

976
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:46,188
Thank you.

977
00:58:47,814 --> 00:58:49,775
- Have a good day.
- Stop right there.

978
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:50,859
Come here.

979
00:58:51,276 --> 00:58:52,986
Where are you going?
We haven't found it yet.

980
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,112
I'll look for it.

981
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:55,197
- As you should, right?
- Yes.

982
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:02,955
We'll be right back.

983
00:59:03,705 --> 00:59:05,415
Stay right here, and don't move an inch.

984
00:59:12,381 --> 00:59:13,715
Oh, my goodness!

985
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:15,801
What the hell are you doing?

986
00:59:16,927 --> 00:59:19,221
Oh, no. What are you doing?

987
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:23,308
Hello.

988
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:24,685
Hey.

989
00:59:25,018 --> 00:59:27,354
Have you seen a black notebook
in the garbage?

990
00:59:27,437 --> 00:59:28,981
No, I haven't.

991
00:59:29,064 --> 00:59:30,065
Keep looking.

992
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:34,736
- Open Sesame.
- Yes?

993
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,321
Get on it. Don't piss me off.

994
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:37,614
Yes, sir!

995
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:41,952
Man!

996
00:59:42,452 --> 00:59:43,453
Nothing yet?

997
00:59:43,537 --> 00:59:44,580
I don't think so.

998
00:59:45,122 --> 00:59:49,751
CLOTHING COLLECTION BIN

999
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,553
Hey, Ms. Shin. I'm busy right now.

1000
00:59:59,636 --> 01:00:03,807
Aren't you on a break? Why are you busy?
That's a business trip, not a vacation.

1001
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:06,393
I know. Is something wrong?

1002
01:00:06,476 --> 01:00:08,437
No, nothing is wrong.

1003
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,564
But I just got a load of scraps

1004
01:00:10,647 --> 01:00:13,317
and there was an account book in the pile.

1005
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:17,946
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

1006
01:00:19,865 --> 01:00:22,951
REPORT ON S SHOPPING'S CHARGES
ON OFFSHORE TAX EVASION

1007
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:29,875
I was wondering who sent it,
and it's S Shopping.

1008
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:34,087
It matches the police report perfectly.

1009
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:35,881
That they're in the clear.

1010
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:38,342
Mr. Baek

1011
01:00:39,259 --> 01:00:41,428
is it really possible to prepare this

1012
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:42,846
just overnight?

1013
01:00:42,929 --> 01:00:45,557
They must've forged the report
to go with the police report.

1014
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:48,810
So

1015
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:51,521
they got the report from the police
in advance

1016
01:00:51,605 --> 01:00:54,066
and saw the emergency arrest coming?

1017
01:01:02,032 --> 01:01:04,868
Have you compared the reports
from S Shopping and the police?

1018
01:01:05,035 --> 01:01:06,203
Do we stand a chance?

1019
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,623
You knew you didn't wait
because we stood a chance.

1020
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:13,043
You want the judge
to crush us in court, then?

1021
01:01:15,212 --> 01:01:18,173
How dare you cross boundaries
when I'm doing this for you?

1022
01:01:19,257 --> 01:01:22,594
If you can't do it,
let him go after the 48 hours are over.

1023
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:26,014
The prosecution has dignity to maintain.

1024
01:01:34,189 --> 01:01:35,232
Man.

1025
01:01:35,649 --> 01:01:38,568
Dignity? You're putting us to shame.

1026
01:01:39,528 --> 01:01:41,863
At this rate, the case will close
without charges.

1027
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:46,827
I held him in custody for 48 hours
with the emergency arrest

1028
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,203
and what? No charges?

1029
01:01:49,121 --> 01:01:52,249
And the police closed the investigation
once we took over.

1030
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:57,379
I get why people die of shame now.

1031
01:02:14,646 --> 01:02:15,731
Ms. Shin!

1032
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:16,815
Han-young!

1033
01:02:29,953 --> 01:02:30,954
DAEHAN CENTRAL PARTY, CHO HU-HEON

1034
01:02:31,121 --> 01:02:32,998
SUPREME COURT, KIM JUN-MAN

1035
01:02:49,389 --> 01:02:50,432
He's coming.

1036
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:56,396
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

1037
01:03:22,172 --> 01:03:23,340
Serving in the military

1038
01:03:23,423 --> 01:03:26,426
is an honorable responsibility
for all Korean men.

1039
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,513
We must not allow those
with high social status

1040
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,390
to meddle with this responsibility.

1041
01:03:33,099 --> 01:03:34,351
The courts of Korea will put

1042
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,728
all of those involved
in conscription evasion

1043
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:38,688
to strict trial under the law

1044
01:03:39,564 --> 01:03:42,067
regardless of their social statuses.

1045
01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:44,444
The court will condemn

1046
01:03:44,528 --> 01:03:46,947
not only those who evaded conscription

1047
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:50,659
but also those who colluded in
or supported the evasion

1048
01:03:50,742 --> 01:03:52,369
without exception.

1049
01:03:54,246 --> 01:03:56,540
No preferential treatment or tolerance

1050
01:03:56,623 --> 01:03:58,291
will be allowed.

1051
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:00,627
Everyone

1052
01:04:01,586 --> 01:04:03,964
I promise
that all will be punished heavily

1053
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:05,966
as they deserve

1054
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:09,052
for abusing their power

1055
01:04:09,135 --> 01:04:10,387
invested by the people.

1056
01:04:11,805 --> 01:04:13,640
MR. PRESIDENT PARK GWANG-TO

1057
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,058
I will now read the names.

1058
01:04:15,934 --> 01:04:18,228
Senior Presidential Economic Advisor
Jang Jun-seo

1059
01:04:18,895 --> 01:04:21,064
Senior Presidential Secretary
for Civil Affairs, Seo Ji-ho

1060
01:04:21,898 --> 01:04:24,067
CEO of Baekheon Group, Oh Yu-jun

1061
01:04:24,526 --> 01:04:26,820
Party Leader Cho Hu-heon
of the Daehan Central Party

1062
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:29,281
Justice Kim Jun-man

1063
01:04:30,282 --> 01:04:33,618
and Member Lee Yeong-hyeon
of the New People's Future Party.

1064
01:04:34,744 --> 01:04:38,290
THE JUDGE RETURNS

1065
01:05:02,397 --> 01:05:03,982
He seems ambitious.

1066
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:05,650
He's complicating everything.

1067
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:07,193
Since it's come to this

1068
01:05:07,277 --> 01:05:09,362
let's check what type Lee Han-young is.

1069
01:05:09,446 --> 01:05:11,031
You're kidding me.

1070
01:05:11,114 --> 01:05:14,284
Because people finally feel regret
when death is at their doorstep.

1071
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:15,702
It's like you've died once.

1072
01:05:15,785 --> 01:05:16,828
Of course not.

1073
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:18,413
Sin-jin directly reached out to me.

1074
01:05:18,496 --> 01:05:20,290
He wants to know what kind of guy I am.

1075
01:05:20,373 --> 01:05:22,876
In our previous lives, he killed me
without having spoken a word with me

1076
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:25,712
but he wants to team up with me
as soon as we meet this time?

1077
01:05:25,795 --> 01:05:27,547
The Minister of Justice has
the confirmation hearing in two weeks.

1078
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:28,965
Can you oust him before that?

1079
01:05:29,049 --> 01:05:31,426
I'll do everything it takes
to become someone you need.

1080
01:05:33,887 --> 01:05:35,889
