00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,820
No, it's not urgent, but...

334
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,767
I'm asking as your uncle now.

335
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:09,800
I'm just curious if work's manageable,

336
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,133
if there are difficulties,

337
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:14,000
or if you need anything.

338
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Work is completely manageable,
and there's nothing particularly hard.

339
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,667
And whenever I need something,
you just buy it for me.

340
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:20,833
What's this about all of a sudden?

341
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,767
Feeling guilty about only
giving attention to Manager Jang?

342
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:24,100
No, what are you talking about?

343
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,633
To me, you're always number one.

344
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,133
Oh, how nice.

345
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,567
I mean it.

346
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:31,733
Ah, come on.

347
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:34,467
Stop beating around the bush.
What's going on?

348
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,700
Want me to ask Manager something?

349
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,633
That's not what I meant,

350
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,700
but if you insist.

351
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,133
Why am I like this? Why do I keep crying?

352
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,033
Are you okay?

353
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,733
Oh, yes.

354
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,200
The morning sickness,

355
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,684
I only saw it in dramas,
but it must be really tough.

356
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:09,967
Is there any particular dish
you're craving or would like to eat?

357
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:13,067
I thought I could recommend
a lunch menu today.

358

For some reason, I think I could eat that.

362
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,733
Thank you for coming all this way.

363
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,900
I couldn't forget the taste
of the sugar-glazed sweet potatoes I had.

364
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,933
I'm the grateful one.

365
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,100
That sales boost you gave us was huge.

366
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,700
Next time, I'll make sure
to boost the sales even more.

367
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,400
Then, I'll leave it in your hands today.

368
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,767
- Thank you.
- Um,

369
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:44,867
may I give you a hand?

370
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:47,467
I used to be pretty skilled
with knives back in the day.

371
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,400
My forearms...

372
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,767
Oh, they're covered, so you can't see them.

373
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,867
These muscles were built from knife work.

374
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,600
Want me to show some skill?

375
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,833
Please don't.

376
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,033
Okay.

Cooking isn't done brutishly by force.

378

It's about wrist flick, like Chef here.

Not easy.

380
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,900
- Is she angry?
- It's because of you.

381

Stop showing off.

382
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,000

lots of jujube tea syrup drinks.

and get an IV drip. It's that bad.

Oh, what could there possibly be?

457

No, there might be something.

458

Yes, I understand.

474
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,733
And besides managing existing clients,

475
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:34,767
you all know we need to develop
new client relationships too, right?

Yes.

477

Shouldn't the sales team
get some applause too?

478
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:39,868
Ah.

479
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,700
Why do my eyes just
want to close after eating?

480
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,500
I need to wake up a bit.

481
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,533
Oh, Assistant Manager Cha!

482
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:48,100
- Oh.
- It's been a while.

483
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,433
Manager, how have you been?

484
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:51,804
What brings you to our floor?

485
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:53,564
Oh...

Here to see Manager Jang?

487

I'm jealous of you, Assistant Manager Cha.

496
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:19,667
By the way, is everything okay
with Manager Jang?

497
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,900
She can't seem to focus and seems sick often.

498
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,633
Is that so?

499
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:28,100
I haven't heard anything.

500
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,933
Hui Won works so hard, that's probably why.

501
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:32,400
She's a workaholic, you know.

502
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,767
Yeah? Well, if nothing's wrong, that's good.

503
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,367
Ah, then I'll head down first.

504
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:39,100
Yes, please go ahead.

505
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:56,833
Are you okay?

506
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,867
If you're going to scold me, do it later.

507
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:00,800
I don't even have the energy
to get scolded today.

508
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Am I someone who scolds you every day?

509
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,833
I'm worried.

510
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,967
But this boyfriend of yours...

511
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,167
Oh, sorry.

512
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:12,900
Hey, here.

513
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,733
If it's tough, want to go to the hospital?

514
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:18,367
No, it's just the morning sickness.

515
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:20,533
Let's go get a prescription for that.

516
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:21,700
I'll go with you.

517
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,333
If someone sees us, they might
misunderstand. I'll handle it myself.

518
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,233
You said you could handle it,
but you seem off.

519
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,400
Here.

520
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,633
Hold on to it properly.

521
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:47,567
Don't spill it.

522
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,000
Oh.

523
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:53,733
Thank you.

524
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:01,833
Call me if it gets hard.

525
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,433
Even at dawn.

526
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:04,600
Got it.

527
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,433
Go quickly.

528
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,067
That male friend worked at our company?

529
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,900
Oh my, I went all out washing the jujubes

530
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,367
and now my whole body aches.

531
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,200
You know I shed my blood, sweat,
and tears for that jujube syrup, right?

532
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,600
Try putting some real effort into me
instead of everyone else.

533
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,133
If I'm choosing, I want
grand gestures, not details.

534
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:29,000
You know, something big. That kind of thing.

535
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,867
Are you even listening?

536
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:33,467
The report.

537
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,767
The report?

538
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:35,867
The report is really not good.

539
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:37,033
I thought it was fine.

540
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:38,200
No.

541
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,667
From beginning to end,
there isn't a single part I like.

542
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,600
- Get the person in charge to redo it...
- No.

543
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,700
No need for that.

544
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,467
I know someone who's
perfectly suited for this job.

545
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,267
You wanted to see me?

546
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:54,364
Assistant Manager Cha Min Uk?

547
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:57,967
I heard you are famous in the sales team
for being diligent and meticulous.

548
00:26:57,967 --> 00:26:59,164
They say you're the king of organization.

549
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:00,668
Oh.

550
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,567
And?

551
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:08,333
The reports from the sales team
sometimes feel rough, so I was curious.

552
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:12,300
I wondered just how meticulous
your reports would be.

553
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,367
Well,

554
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:22,767
it can be done
by the end of this week, right?

555
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,500
This week...

556
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,967
All of these?

557
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,667
Yes.

558
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:34,700
Yes, I understand.

559
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,300
Oh.

560
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,556
I hope I'm not taking time away
from your date, Assistant Manager Cha.

561
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:47,800
Oh.

562
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,133
I don't have a girlfriend.

563
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,633
Is that so?

564
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:56,333
That's surprising. You're quite good-looking.

565
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,067
Well then.

566
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,867
And perhaps,

567
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,367
is there someone you like?

568
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:07,833
You don't have anyone you like either?

569
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,533
Pardon?

570
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:21,333
Is he complimenting me? Or picking a fight?

571
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,000
He's a bit odd.

572
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,933
Are you handling
all the company work by yourself?

573
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,267
Wow.

574
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:30,000
Work really should be done
like Assistant Manager Cha does it, right?

575
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,033
Wow, nice, yeah.

576
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,400
Ms. Ye Jin, Ms. Ye Jin!

577
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,333
The weather's gloomy today.

578
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,000
- Did everyone bring an umbrella?
- Is it supposed to rain today?

579
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,433
I have one at the office.

580
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,700
I'm fine. I plan to go
for a run after work today.

581
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,433
What? They say it's going to rain heavily.

582
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:53,033
Ah, haven't you heard
of the 'rain-run' trend these days?

583
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:54,567
- You gotta run when you can run.
- Look at that.

584
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,300
Tak Soo is so passionate.

585
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,267
- What about Assistant Manager Choi?
- Of course I have one.

586
00:28:58,267 --> 00:29:01,367
If I don't bring it, who else is going to?

587
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:03,400
On a rainy day like this,

588
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,600
is there no man to get wet in the rain
with me instead of just using an umbrella?

589
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,367
Nope, none. And you'll catch a cold.

590
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:09,467
This isn't romance.
It's turning into a disaster movie.

591
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:12,133
Manager, your way of thinking is really...

592
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:13,133
Be honest.

593
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:15,600
Your wife scolded you a lot
when you were dating, right?

594
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,267
No, she was totally into me.

595
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,967
Hey, Manager Jang! Do you have an umbrella?

596
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:25,033
- Is it raining?
- They said it'll rain heavily tonight.

597
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,600
Looks like I'll need to leave
on the dot today.

598
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,833
I didn't even bring an umbrella.

599
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:33,000
Is Manager Jang still feeling unwell
from the norovirus?

600
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,200
Even so, her pale skin looks even paler.

601
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,800
She used to pull three all-nighters,
but now she's leaving early.

602
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,667
Are you having a meeting or just chatting?

603
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:42,767
Team Leader, did you bring an umbrella?

604
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:43,900
They said it's supposed
to rain heavily tonight.

605
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,533
Why? Should I use yours, Manager Nah?

606
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm really sorry. I only have one myself.

607
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,833
Unless you're going to hand over yours
or stop the rain yourself,

608
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:55,500
stop worrying about the weather
and get back to work.

609
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,867
Is there someone you like?

610
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:02,400
You don't have anyone you like either?

611
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,067
Childish. So childish.

612
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,067
What, are you a kindergartener?

613
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:07,500
No way, did you hear that?

614
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,733
Instead of doing your work,
you were eavesdropping outside? Jeez.

615
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:14,167
Since when did you summon
employees separately to assign work?

616
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:16,700
Just because he's close with Manager Jang.

617
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,300
What did Assistant Manager Cha do wrong?

618
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,433
It seems like you've got
some misunderstanding.

619
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:24,200
Core talents of the company
are always under special management.

620
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,667
He's famous in the sales team
for being diligent and meticulous.

621
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:29,300
And it's only natural for a president
to show interest in employees.

622
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
Should I just ignore it?

623
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,067
Oh, is that so?

624
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:35,367
Then why don't you pay some attention to me,
who's stuck by your side all day, huh?

625
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,233
My birthday's coming up.

626
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,233
Oh, wait a second.

627
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,867
This is a bit sensitive.

628
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:42,767
You don't know my birthday, do you?

629
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,467
Come on, how long have we known each other?

630
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:55,367
October...

631
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:56,667
21st, right?

632
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,800
Wow.

633
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,833
I suspected it, but still...

634
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,200
It's the 25th.

635
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,933
October 25th.

636
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:05,733
This is annoying.

637
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,200
You keep calling me Secretary Go.

638
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,533
But you do remember my name, right?

639
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,400
Why would you say something that hurtful?

640
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,833
You're talking nonsense.

641
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,500
You!

642
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,900
You're acting unlike yourself, that's why.

643
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,433
Ugh, I don't know what's so special about you

644
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:24,200
that I have to drive you home
on a rainy day like this.

645
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,433
It's raining outside now?

646
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,467
It's been raining for a while.

647
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,433
Why? Do you have business
with the New Product Development Team?

648
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:35,500
Just checking if our company's
core departments and key talents

649
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,333
are preparing to leave work properly.

650
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,600
Wait, do you even care about
when I leave work?

651
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,867
Hey, hold on.

652
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,633
Don't tell me...

653
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,167
You're worried Manager Jang
might not have an umbrella?

654
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:48,133
You didn't care when I got completely soaked.

655
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,733
Just check real quick and leave right away.

656
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,233
I'll head home on my own.

657
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,233
Ah, I can go?

658
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:54,433
You should've said so earlier.

659
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:56,833
I'm clocking out on time.

660
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:57,900
Si Hyeong!

661
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,500
Don't make it obvious.
Seriously, don't let it show.

662
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,233
Alright.

663
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,300
- Good work today.
- You worked hard.

664
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,533
- Yes, see you tomorrow.
- Yes.

665
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:36,867
That's right.

666
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:40,133
Jang Hui Won wouldn't
have brought an umbrella.

667
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,012
Thank you.

668
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:56,060
Oh.

669
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:10,533
Don't tell me you were
planning to walk in the rain?

670
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:12,000
What could I do? I didn't have an umbrella.

671
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The chance of rain was over 70%.
Did you not check the weather?

672
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,333
I've been too busy to check.

673
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,400
Unlike some people,
every day's a battle for me.

674
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,733
What if you, a pregnant woman, catch a cold?

675
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,067
Ugh, enough with the nagging.

676
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:27,233
What kind of president chases an employee
after work just to nag them?

677
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:28,500
So why did you come?

678
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,600
Do you need something from me?

679
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,500
It's not leftovers, and it's not
from someone else. Take it.

680
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:49,767
You drove me just to give me this?

681
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:52,200
'Just'? Just?

682
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,533
Do you even know what kind of
handmade syrup this is?

683
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,967
How would I know that?

684
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,400
Well, this syrup...

685
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,700
I personally made it,
paying attention to every single step.

686
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,733
Have you ever made jujube syrup?

687
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,233
You have to scrub it clean with baking soda,

688
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:07,833
remove the stems and seeds,
and carefully prepare each piece of fruit.

689
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,367
It takes a lot of care to grind it finely

690
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:11,367
and simmer it over low heat.

691
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:14,533
Are you angry because it was hard to make?

692
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:18,133
Do you know how many batches
failed just to make this one bottle?

693
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:19,867
- And you call it 'just'?
- So why bother?

694
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,267
No one asked you, but why?

695
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,967
Well, obviously...

696
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,167
Because you are a top-tier employee.

697
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,467
- What?
- They say you're outstanding.

698
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:34,067
Your problem-solving skills are excellent.

699
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:36,867
We have so much to tackle together.

700
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:40,133
I can't just watch you wear yourself out.

701
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
So I brought something
good for morning sickness,

702
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,067
yet you are drinking cheap stuff
from another man.

703
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:48,467
How could I not get angry?

704
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:50,167
What?

705
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:52,867
Nothing.

706
00:35:02,364 --> 00:35:04,333
[Mom]

707
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:17,033
Hold on, I need to take this call.

708
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:18,733
Yes.

709
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,867
- Yes.
- Son?

710
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:32,200
That high-pitched voice means
another blind date, right?

711
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,633
If that's what this is about, I don't need...

712
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:36,067
Why? Are you seeing someone?

713
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:40,433
Don't tell me that's why you asked
for the jujube syrup recipe back then?

714
00:35:40,433 --> 00:35:43,400
- Mom.
- Well, if not, forget it.

715
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,967
I met someone really nice
when I went for a massage.

716
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,700
They say one detail speaks volumes.

717
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,133
She grew up very upright
under a single father.

718
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,700
Mom, you don't have prejudice
against things like that, do you?

719
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,433
I'm saying that because not many
were raised properly in those circumstances.

720
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:01,000
Mom, you shouldn't say that.

721
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,133
Then what about Se Hyeon?

722
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,533
Se Hyeon turned out fine

723
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,467
because you played the role
of a father since her childhood.

724
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:06,667
No.

725
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,400
She would've grown up better
if it weren't for me.

726
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,433
Without pain, just surrounded by love.

727
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:26,967
[Mourn]

728
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:29,867
Uncle, why are you crying?

729
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,067
Se Hyeon, you are here.

730
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm not crying.

731
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,764
- I never cry.
- Where's Dad?

732
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:47,500
Why is Dad over there?

733
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,867
He is...

734
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,633
I'm sorry.

735
00:37:10,684 --> 00:37:12,764
I'm sorry.

736
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:23,333
I'm outside now. Let's talk later.

737
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,067
Du Jun.

738
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,867
Food delivery's here.

739
00:37:38,867 --> 00:37:40,567
What's the occasion?

740
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:46,067
No matter how busy you are, you have to eat.

741
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:48,467
You look thinner every time I see you.

742
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:49,567
Cut down on the coffee too.

743
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,967
And stretch your neck
and shoulders more often.

744
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:53,167
Okay.

745
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,767
Hard to tell who's the mom
and who's the daughter.

746
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:58,433
Dad would've really liked

747
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,533
seeing us like this, right?

748
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:03,500
Do you miss Dad?

749
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,133
Not really.

750
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:07,467
Uncle's like a dad to me anyway.

751
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,967
But he isn't your dad.

752
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:11,700
Your dad was so good to you.

753
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,333
Well, I was too young back then.

754
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:18,233
If not for that incident, your dad
would've been way better than your uncle.

755
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,667
Don't say things that would hurt Dad.

756
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,867
You startled me.

757
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:27,633
Alright, let's eat quickly.
You must be hungry, hurry.

758
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,300
Alright.

759
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:35,467
Sorry, the call took longer than expected.

760
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:36,633
What's wrong? Are you sick?

761
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:38,267
I'm okay.

762
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:41,267
I got caught in the rain earlier,
so I feel off.

763
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:43,433
You have a fever.

764
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:44,867
Let's go to the hospital right now.

765
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,200
No.

766
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,167
I'll be fine if I just go home and rest.

767
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:49,600
And what if your fever gets worse?

768
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,100
Don't you know pregnant women
can't take medicine casually?

769
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,467
I'm really fine.

770
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:59,000
I have to go to work tomorrow.
I just want to go home and rest.

771
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,700
I'm really okay.

772
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,900
Oh, that's cold.

773
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,900
You need to cool down, stay still.

774
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,367
My house is still messy too.

775
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:15,933
Is that what you're worried about now?

776

I'll enjoy the homemade syrup.

777
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:25,167
No one's ever cared for me
when I was sick like this before.

778
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,833
To be honest, I'm touched.

779
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,500
At least you know that now.

780
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,300
Wait a moment.

781

Your fever isn't breaking.

Why don't you tell the company
and take some rest?

Let's go on a field trip together today.

818
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,340
I'm right outside your place,
so get ready and come out.

819
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,460
Outside my place?

820
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:35,300
What do I do?

821
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,916
Ah, seriously.

822
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,633
Jeez.

823
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:42,667
What am I supposed to do if he
contacts me out of the blue like this?

824
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:47,533
But is this a date or work?

825
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:49,433
He said it was a field trip earlier.

826
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:51,200
Ah, I don't know, I don't know.

827
00:43:53,212 --> 00:43:55,836
Is this better?

828
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:58,332
This one looks a bit prettier.

829
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,100
Those are the eyes of someone who's in love.

830
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
No, it's not!

831
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,300
You look cool.

832
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,600
I mean, the clothes, the clothes!

833
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,967
Judging by how dressed up you are,
were you expecting a date or something?

834
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:37,433
Well, you said we should
go out three times a week or so.

835
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,933
Let's just go.

836
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:43,033
Where are we going?

837
00:44:50,767 --> 00:44:54,433
I'm saying this just in case
you might misunderstand.

838
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:57,000
About what I said, that I was touched
or no one ever cared...

839
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,967
You're not actually believing that, right?

840
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:01,833
Weren't you really touched?

841
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,133
I knew this would happen.

842
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,500
Do you really think I meant it?

843
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,567
Even back in school, during every break,

844
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:09,700
so many guys would come bearing gifts.

845
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:14,267
But I didn't ask.

846
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:19,100
Anyway, yesterday I had a fever

847
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,600
and said some nonsense, just so you know.

848
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,133
You're the one who contacted me?

849
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:43,233
Yes, I contacted you through my secretary.

850
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:44,300
Yes.

851
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,404
- I'm Kang Du Jun.
- Yes.

852
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:46,588
[President Kang Du Jun]

853
00:45:47,228 --> 00:45:51,867
Oh, my. I never imagined the President
would personally visit our hop farm.

854
00:45:51,867 --> 00:45:54,467
So it really is work?

855
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:58,167
We might be working together for a long time,
so I wanted to greet you personally.

856
00:45:58,167 --> 00:45:59,233
Ah, and this is our...

857
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:00,967
Hello.

858
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,567
I'm Manager Jang Hui Won
from the New Product Development Team.

859
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:04,633
Oh, yes.

860
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:06,833
I rushed out and forgot my business card.

861
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,367
Oh.

862
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:11,500
You must be a very capable employee.

863
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,700
Thank you both for coming such a long way.

864
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,167
Please feel free to look around.

865
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:18,233
If you have any questions, call me anytime.

866
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,967
Yes.

867
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:30,967
Let's go.

868
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,400
Why did you wear such uncomfortable shoes?

869
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,100
If you'd told me where we were going
beforehand, that would've been nice.

870
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,767
Well then, shall we go
somewhere nice for dinner?

871
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:54,700
No, thanks.

872
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,333
What are you doing now?

873
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:00,533
Don't do that.

874
00:48:00,533 --> 00:48:02,200
- Don't do that.
- Feels refreshing, right?

875
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,252
Are you trying to pick a fight?

876
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:06,267
Huh?

877
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:08,100
Stop it, let's stop.

878
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,167
What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

879
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:13,067
Feels good, right?

880
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:14,767
Jeez.

881
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:21,333
The beer pairing business
targeting campers is

882
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,667
- Our Manager Jang's...
- Manager Jang.

883
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,267
- That new product set to launch next year...
- The new pitch.

884
00:48:25,267 --> 00:48:27,133
Ah, Manager Jang is out
on an assignment, huh?

885
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:28,633
- No.
- Manager Jang, just now,

886
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:33,667
we got a call from the factory
about the Try golden ratio glass...

887
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:35,633
Manager Jang is out on an assignment, right?

888
00:48:35,633 --> 00:48:37,433
Exactly, yes.

889
00:48:37,433 --> 00:48:38,633
Manager Jang!

890
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:41,067
Ah, right. She's not here today.

891
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:44,000
It feels kind of empty
with just Manager Jang missing.

892
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,200
Exactly.

893
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,867
I never knew Manager Jang's
absence would feel this big.

894
00:48:47,867 --> 00:48:49,000
Is the field trip going well?

895
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,300
Should I give her a call?

896
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,467
- Yes.
- Then we should cover for her.

897
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:55,633
Is this the time to wistfully stare
at her empty seat and chat?

898
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:58,467
Why is the team leader in such a low mood?

899
00:48:58,467 --> 00:49:02,100
Do you want me to show you
what 'really low mood' looks like?

900
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:08,833
Huh? What? Do you need me for something?

901
00:49:09,933 --> 00:49:13,333
Even I, the team leader, haven't had it,
yet a field trip with the President?

902
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,167
Does that even make sense?

903
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,400
Did you get home safely
after the team dinner?

904
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,036
Team Leader Bang Soon Yi.

905
00:49:35,036 --> 00:49:38,400
Yes, thanks to you.

906
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,333
But I asked you not to
call me by my full name.

907
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:43,700
It's a bit old-fashioned.

908
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,500
My parents just made it up
in a haste when life was tough.

909
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,467
Bang Soon Yi.

910
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:50,800
It's dainty and cute.

911
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:55,067
Pardon?

912
00:49:56,028 --> 00:49:58,733
Ah.

913
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:01,033
You have unique taste.

914
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:03,400
Come on, it's cute.

915
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:14,067
Oh, I mean the name is cute, of course.

916
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:30,733
Ah.

917
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,900
Ah, wow, the corn is perfectly cooked.

918
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,033
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my. Give it here.

919
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:48,100
Sit down, sit down.

920
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,333
Oh, it's fine.

921
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:56,367
It's way too much for us to eat.

922
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,967
Go ahead, just help yourself.

923
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:00,367
Yes, thank you.

924
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:02,667
Want one?

925
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:05,533
Wow, it's been ages since I last had corn.

926
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:07,533
I'll enjoy it!

927
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:13,767
Did you sprinkle sugar on this?

928
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:16,067
How is it this sweet?

929
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:20,133
President, you should try one too.

930
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:21,200
Delicious, right?

931
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,067
Yes, it is delicious.

932
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:25,833
Oh, it's just steamed.

933
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,433
My wife grew it herself.

934
00:51:27,433 --> 00:51:29,767
She's so passionate about corn.

935
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:31,800
She knows how much work it takes,

936
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,533
but she's very enthusiastic
about tending the soil and watering.

937
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,867
I can tell just by how plump
these kernels are.

938
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:43,633
I can really taste the care
you both put into this farm.

939
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,167
It's truly delicious.

940
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,867
The best?

941
00:51:58,067 --> 00:52:01,567
I'll send the email as soon as I confirm it.

942
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:03,233
Yes, I'll be in touch.

943
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:04,933
Okay.

944
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,500
That car from before.

945
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,567
This is the President's designated spot.

946

[Reserved Parking]

947
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:29,233
I'd like to see a report organized
in your unique style.

948
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,633
It can be done
by the end of this week, right?

949
00:52:30,633 --> 00:52:33,100
Why are you interfering
with her sleeping schedule?

950
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,933
From now on, please refrain
from calling Ms. Jang Hui Won

951
00:52:34,933 --> 00:52:38,333
for personal matters after 7 PM.

952
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,492
Well.

00:52:53,867 --> 00:52:54,867
[Reserved Parking]

954
00:52:58,332 --> 00:52:59,772
Let's go home!

955
00:52:59,772 --> 00:53:01,567
- Time to go!
- Let's go.

956
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,133
Oh, Assistant Manager Cha.

957
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:04,933
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

958
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:06,167
Are you heading home now?

959
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:08,933
You came for Manager Jang, huh?

960
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:10,967
Yes, I came to see
if we could leave together,

961
00:53:10,967 --> 00:53:12,400
but I don't see her.

962
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,900
Manager Jang went on
a field trip with the President.

963
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,900
- I guess you didn't hear.
- A field trip?

964
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,133
Yes, and just the two of them.

965
00:53:18,133 --> 00:53:19,567
- Just the two of them?
- Yes.

966
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:21,200
They said they're visiting
a hop farm for research.

967
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,800
I knew Manager Jang was ambitious,
but I didn't realize she was this driven.

968
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,567
I'd feel uncomfortable
being alone with the President.

969
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:32,467
I bet the President feels uncomfortable
being alone with Manager Nah too.

970
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:35,200
- Assistant Manager Choi.
- Since they went out,

971
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,967
will they clock out from there together?

972
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,467
Well, they'll probably
leave straight from there.

973
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:41,467
They say the water
and scenery are beautiful there.

974
00:53:41,467 --> 00:53:44,100
It feels more like a getaway than work.

975
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,200
Come on, don't you all know Manager Jang?

976
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,166
She'll work diligently and return
tomorrow with an amazing idea.

977
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:50,167
- Right!
- Probably not?

978
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:51,633
Admit it, Manager Jang is passionate!

979
00:53:51,633 --> 00:53:54,267
Then let's passionately
clock out for the day!

980
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:55,967
We should go.

981
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:57,500
- Yes.
- Come on in.

982
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,233
Goodbye.

983
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,600
See you.

984
00:54:15,867 --> 00:54:18,533
The farm is larger than I expected
with numerous hop plants,

985
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:21,500
so I think future collaboration
would be beneficial.

986
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,667
Sign a contract with us.

987
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,933
We'll help you earn five times
your current annual revenue.

988
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:28,300
What? Five times?

989
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,533
I know you already supply domestic hops
to several other breweries.

990
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:33,067
We won't interfere with that.

991
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:35,767
However, to meet our supply demands,

992
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:38,012
you'll need to triple your current
hop production.

993
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:39,033
Is that feasible?

994
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:41,833
We have to make it happen, of course.

995
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:43,467
Oh dear, honey.

996
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:47,388
Absolutely. We'll meet the demand
even if we have to hire more help.

997
00:54:47,388 --> 00:54:51,067
- Oh, wow.
- Thank you.

998
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:54,267
You'll be swamped starting tomorrow. Wow.

999
00:54:54,267 --> 00:54:55,967
You've worked hard.

1000
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,933
You'll get busy soon!

1001
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:03,533
Don't they look perfect together?

1002
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,500
What is marriage, really?

1003
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,267
How can two people from different lives

1004
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,067
cherish each other like their own selves

1005
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:16,733
for so long like that?

1006
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:19,133
Someone said people marry

1007
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:22,167
because they desperately
need someone on their side.

1008
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:24,300
Marriage

1009
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,133
completes the insecure part of themselves.

1010
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:32,333
My side...

1011
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,033
You should've been on my side.

1012
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:37,300
Even if everyone else turns their backs,

1013
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,100
you should have been with me!

1014
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:47,800
And if the person you trusted
to be on your side betrays you,

1015
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,267
doesn't it hurt even more?

1016
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:54,300
Even if you start out inseparable,

1017
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,667
eventually you may end up
as enemies or strangers.

1018
00:55:56,667 --> 00:56:00,333
Maybe it's better not to start at all.

1019
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:05,967
Is it

1020
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:07,933
because of your mother?

1021
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,833
[Mom: My life got completely
ruined because of you.]

1022
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:14,000
My life got completely ruined because of you.

1023
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
You should never have been born.

1024
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:23,067
You don't need to react
to words meant to hurt you.

1025
00:56:23,067 --> 00:56:25,567
It's not your fault. Far from it.

1026
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:28,800
Did you happen to see my text?

1027
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,000
I didn't mean to see it, sorry.

1028
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,133
But your life is too precious
to be swayed by such words.

1029
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:37,500
Don't pretend to understand me.

1030
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,333
You grew up sheltered, so you might not
realize how hard that is,

1031
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:45,533
but for some, it's a lifelong struggle.

1032
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:48,000
Wait, I...

1033
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,367
Please drop me off here.

1034
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,567
Thank you for the ride.

1035
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:11,000
I'll should go.

1036
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,900
Are you really leaving like this?

1037
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:16,067
Thank you for your hard work today.

1038
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:19,633
I'll send you the hop farm proposal
as soon as it's finalized.

1039
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,933
No...

1040
00:57:34,467 --> 00:57:37,433
You shouldn't take it out
on someone who took your side.

1041
00:57:37,433 --> 00:57:40,400
How pathetic. Truly pathetic, Jang Hui Won.

1042
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:49,033
Huh?

1043
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:50,767
Min Uk.

1044
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:56,433
Where have you been?

1045
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:58,000
Were you with that person?

1046
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,033
- Huh?
- The baby's father.

1047
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:03,067
Is it President Kang Du Jun?

1048
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:07,333
I see.

1049
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:09,267
I'm sorry, I was going to tell you...

1050
00:58:09,267 --> 00:58:11,367
What about the baby?

1051
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,167
Have you decided?

1052
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,800
I'm going to keep it.

1053
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,967
- Hui Won.
- I'm not giving up my dream.

1054
00:58:17,967 --> 00:58:19,200
I'm just postponing it.

1055
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,967
After giving birth, I'll thrive
and do everything I want.

1056
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:28,700
But you said you didn't want marriage.

1057
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,667
And now you plan to keep it
and raise it alone?

1058
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:34,133
I can do it. I can.

1059
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:37,467
While you're thinking about this,

1060
00:58:37,467 --> 00:58:40,433
where is he, and what is he doing?

1061
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,100
Shouldn't there be some plan?

1062
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,567
He said he would take responsibility.

1063
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:45,700
I refused.

1064
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,033
He said he'd take responsibility?

1065
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:49,300
Is he saying you should marry him or what?

1066
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,068
A chaebol heir who can
do anything with money,

1067
00:58:51,068 --> 00:58:53,067
can he really do that just because of a kid?

1068
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:54,767
What if I can?

1069
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:01,900
I don't understand why this
is impossible right now.

1070
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,500
- President...
- If something like this happened,

1071
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,500
wouldn't you take responsibility?

1072
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,733
I wouldn't create
such an awkward situation in the first place.

1073
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:08,733
Hey.

1074
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:11,900
If you're planning to use
Hui Won, stop right here.

1075
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,933
She's not someone
for people like you to toy with.

1076
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:18,533
I've never thought of it that way.

1077
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,300
Do you think so too, Ms. Jang Hui Won?

1078
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,900
Do you think I'm toying with you?

1079
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,000
What?

1080
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,533
Then why not check if that's true?

1081
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:32,467
See whether I'm being sincere now.

1082
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:38,833
Lately, I don't know
why I'm having these thoughts.

1083
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:40,400
You'll help, right?

1084
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,433
Ugh, I don't know.

1085
00:59:41,433 --> 00:59:44,033
Oh, do you want some meat, Your Highness?

1086
00:59:44,033 --> 00:59:47,033
I shall prepare the meat, Your Highness.

1087
00:59:47,033 --> 00:59:50,267
I get angry just seeing
her giggle with another guy.

1088
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:55,233
I gave up my lifelong dream
with my own hands.

1089
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:58,867
If I don't work now,
I feel like I'll actually die.

1090
00:59:58,867 --> 01:00:00,733
Please stop telling me to rest.

1091
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:03,167
When she agonizes between work
and the baby, I feel sorry for her.

1092
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:05,167
How can you only think
about yourself until the very end?

1093
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:09,900
If I were you, I would never
live like you, understand?

1094
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:18,767
If she's crying alone,

1095
01:00:18,767 --> 01:00:21,533
it bothers me a lot.

1096
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:24,500
I even wonder why I'm
talking about this right now.

1097
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,667
It's just that...

1098
01:00:26,667 --> 01:00:30,867
I want you to feel a bit
at ease, at least for today.

1099
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:42,733
Does this mean

1100
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,133
I'm falling for you?

1101
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,133
[Epilogue]

1102
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:07,600
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

1103
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,600
Daddy, don't go.

1104
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,033
Don't go.

1105
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:12,700
Daddy.

1106
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,267
Daddy.

1107
01:01:14,267 --> 01:01:17,900
Don't leave Mom behind.

1108
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,733
Daddy.

1109
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:23,167
Daddy.

1110
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:25,767
It isn't easy for you either.

1111
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:27,500
Daddy.

1112
01:01:51,733 --> 01:01:54,167
I'm not leaving.

1113
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:55,867
Never.

1114
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:38,067
Are you avoiding me?

1115
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:40,400
It seems like you've been burdened
because of my confession.

1116
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,500
Don't avoid me.

1117
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,733
You like your friend, huh?

1118
01:02:42,733 --> 01:02:44,167
Why are you just watching and doing nothing?

1119
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:45,167
How truly vulgar.

1120
01:02:45,167 --> 01:02:47,667
The liquor model got a DUI?
Isn't that insane?

1121
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:49,167
If we can't fix this,

1122
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:50,967
it'll be hard to keep our footing.

1123
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,100
Then we must find

1124
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,800
a new model to revitalize our image.

1125
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,200
Well, my colleagues.

1126
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,333
How would they react
if they found out I'm pregnant?

1127
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:58,400
Why? Did anyone say anything to you?

1128
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,567
- She's pregnant!
- Wow! How'd she seduce him?

1129
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:01,967
Well, anyone can get pregnant.

1130
01:03:01,967 --> 01:03:04,867
What matters is whose child it is.

1131
01:03:04,867 --> 01:03:09,067
If it gets tough this time,
will you just give up again?
