- A bet?
- Sounds good.

170
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,433
- Good.
- The winner will do something for us.

171

What? Why's it so noisy this early?

172
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,300
- Oh.
- Team Leader, do you want to join too?

173
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,867
- Join what?
- We were just talking about the contest.

Oh, the contest?

That Hit beer that followed
Try beer? That was my idea.

177

Of course, due to cost issues,
it's now a thing of the past.

178
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,633
So you won through a contest back then too?

179

Oh, it was back in my day.

180
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:42,033
No contest. I pitched it
as an assistant manager.

No, I'm saying I'll give it to you.
So, are you in or not?

I told you before.

00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:54,500
There's this lovely lady I met
at a massage place.

208
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,267
You said that single room felt cramped,
so that's what it was for!

209
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:01,033
You two only said a few words,

210
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,000
so how did she move your heart?

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,033
So, are you married?

Well...

216

I was too pushy, wasn't I?

217
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,800
My son just works

218
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,033
all the time and still isn't married,
so I worry about him.

219
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:31,833
I'm truly happy after getting married.

220

What was so great about it?

221

Well...

222

Nowadays, I spend
a lot of time alone like this.

223
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,900
But it wasn't like this
when the kids were young.

224
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,367
I'd chat about everything
with my husband after work.

225
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:49,200
In summer, we'd go to the beach and swim.

226
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,233
In winter, we'd warm our hands,
have snowball fights, and decorate trees.

227
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:59,196
There was never a time I wasn't happy.

Oh, not at all!

232

I'm so envious.

233

Just hearing this, I can tell you're
a wonderful wife and mother.

234
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:17,333
I think the reason your husband
could comfortably talk about his day,

235
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,367
and your children could laugh
and run around so freely,

236
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,467
is that you created

237
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:28,124
such a warm home.

238
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:31,367
Oh my... I'm going to cry.

239

My son probably doesn't know I feel this way.

240

I'm sure your son knows.

He just hasn't said it yet.

There's something like that.

How should I put it?

Not exactly,

332

but I have my prenatal screening
and suddenly I'm feeling a bit nervous.

What if the results aren't good?

It'll be fine. Don't worry too much.

490
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:53,433
Beautiful thoughts,

491
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,433
good thoughts.

492
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,733
It's bland broth, totally bland.

493
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:02,967
Isn't this just soup with chili paste?

494
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:05,900
- Is this from White Lighthouse now...
- Abandoned souls,

495
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,900
follow me.

496
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,767
What did he say?

497
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,933
Didn't you voluntarily come in on weekends,
saying you were motivated?

498
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,463
From what I see, Manager Nah,

499
00:27:18,463 --> 00:27:20,967
your determination
lasts not three days, but one.

500
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:22,780
If he keeps that up, he'll get
scolded by the Team Leader.

501
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh.

502
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,567
Oh, that startled me.

503
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:28,700
The chair was so comfortable,
so I closed my eyes without realizing it.

504
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
Our company benefits
have gotten way too good lately.

505
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,033
I wonder if there'll be
anything left at this rate?

506
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:35,367
But it looks like Manager Nah
enjoys those benefits the most.

507
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:38,433
That's right. At the last beef dinner,
you ate like there was no tomorrow.

508
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:39,767
And I saw you even had
two bowls of jjamppong.

509
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:43,200
You clock in at the lounge every day
just to use the recliner sofa.

510
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,367
Assistant Manager Choi,
isn't that sofa meant to be used?

511
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:48,300
Anyway, since the President came,
the benefits are on another level.

512
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,567
As they say, a fish rots from the head down.

513
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,124
Our team is first-grade water!

514
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:53,200
First-grade!

515
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,933
Are you sure?

516
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That it's first-grade?

517
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,933
Team Leader, where did you pop up from?

518
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:00,267
Did you set an alarm or something?

519
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:02,967
If the manager's always gossiping,
what do you expect from the rest?

520
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:04,300
Haven't you heard? 'The pupil
surpasses the master.'

521
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,233
Our team members are so capable.

522
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,600
You sure talk a good game.
Alright, let's get back to work.

523
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,233
Unless you want to work weekends again.

524
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,233
Yes.

525
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,500
By the way, Team Leader,

526
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,533
where have you been going?

527
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:17,800
You've been away a lot. Don't tell me...

528
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,400
I think I saw you in the lounge earlier, too.

529
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
I also passed by the lounge...

530
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,600
Alright, let's get back
to work diligently. Fighting!

531
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:29,067
Jeez.

532
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:30,867
- Saw her in the lounge?
- You did?

533
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:33,133
- I did.
- In the lounge?

534
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:35,600
[Round 4]

535
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,533
Alright.

536
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:42,400
Stop growling at each other,
drink up and make up.

537
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,767
Who's growling?

538
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,364
Come on.

539
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,933
Huh? Uh, hold on.

540
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,167
It's not about drinking like this.

541
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:58,367
It's about cheers and making up.

542
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:00,500
Cheers!

543
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,967
I'm drinking this time too.

544
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:04,600
No, no.

545
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,600
Ugh, this doubles my stress. Doubles it.

546
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,700
You know, when I get stressed,
my stomach really acts up.

547
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:22,167
Oh no, here it is right now.

548
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,100
Ugh, I need the restroom.

549
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,833
While I'm in the restroom,
you two make up on your own.

550
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,200
After all that cheering. Cheers!

551
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,900
Sit down.

552
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:37,433
Oh no, I'm not gonna make it.

553
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,233
Did you confess?

554
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:54,700
Do I have to say it?

555
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,567
You haven't done it yet, huh?

556
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:02,067
I haven't done it. Yet.

557
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,567
You mean you couldn't do it.

558
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:06,533
Why? Because you're dealing with me.

559
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,567
How can one night compete with fifteen years?

560
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:17,933
Do you know what Hui Won likes to eat?

561
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:22,500
Her hobbies or habits?
Neighborhoods she frequents? Regular shops?

562
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,267
Ah, what?

563
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:28,267
You don't even properly know
about Hui Won, and then,

564
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:29,596
you've even confessed?

565
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:30,600
What?

566
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,867
You seem to occasionally
forget that I'm the company president.

567
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,100
Wow, petty.

568
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,000
Didn't we agree to drop
the ranks and play fair?

569
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,233
Another bottle of soju here, please.

570
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:43,367
Just bring three bottles.

571
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,533
Looks like we'll finish them quickly.

572
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:13,633
Why are they both doing this to me?

573
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:16,367
Why is the President making
it so obvious at work?

574
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,900
What if someone sees?

575
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,633
And what's with him all of a sudden?

576
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:23,767
What if he gets fired from the company
for competing with the President?

577
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,700
Jeez, why is everyone like this?

578
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,533
I'm tired. Seriously.

579
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,436
Seems like alcohol doesn't sit well
with you, Assistant Manager Cha.

580
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:34,900
Go on.

581
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,700
- You are drunk.
- Drink.

582
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,367
How much did you drink in such a short time?

583
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:40,900
President, do you know
how petty the President is?

584
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,800
- I'm the President?
- He gave me this much paperwork

585
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,367
and told me to sort it out within a week.

586
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,433
No.

587
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:50,267
You are saying things
they won't even remember.

588
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:51,433
Let's go home. Let's go home.

589
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:53,600
Mister, I didn't call a designated driver.
Leave. Hurry.

590
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,033
What are you talking about?

591
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:56,633
- Let's go home.
- No.

592
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:58,900
Excuse me!

593
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

594
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,067
Assistant Manager Cha,
you call a designated driver.

595
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:06,167
I don't have a car.

596
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,000
What, you're sleeping now?

597
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,067
Let's go home. Let's go home. Huh?

598
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:14,767
Ow, hot.

599
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,733
Home...

600
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,367
Let's go home.

601
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:22,267
[Game Over]
Who am I talking to?

602
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,084
Wait...

603
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,533
President.

604
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,467
What is all this?

605
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:34,233
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I bought everything.

606
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:37,233
Chicken, pizza, tteokbokki, sushi...

607
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:40,800
And this... desserts and salad too.

608
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,867
All of this?

609
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:45,667
But what exactly is your favorite food?

610
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:46,900
- What?
- Your hobbies?

611
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,100
I mean, not those random places,
just neighborhoods you often go to,

612
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,167
or regular shops you visit.

613
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:58,333
Did you come here in the middle
of the night to ask that?

614
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,767
Assistant Manager Cha knows everything.

615
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,767
He knows you can't handle spice

616
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,900
so you eat malatang at level 0.5.

617
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,567
He knows you choose spicy cold noodles
over plain cold noodles after meat.

618
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:12,333
He knows everything. Only I don't know.

619
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,933
Are you still not done
with that childish ego fight?

620
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:17,600
Please stop.

621
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,933
What if someone starts suspecting something?

622
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:23,400
Ms. Jang Hui Won,
is that really so important?

623
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,600
Of course it is.

624
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,300
If our relationship is exposed,
I'm the one who'll be judged.

625
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,667
No, no, no.

626
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:35,033
What you're worried about won't happen.

627
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,433
I'll block it all for you.

628
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:51,356
You...

629
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,967
Ugh, jeez.

630
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:01,100
I told them to make up,
but what time is it now, seriously?

631
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,533
Ugh, I'm stressed. She's not
off work already, is she?

632
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:04,700
Hold on.

633
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,756
Oh.

634
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:07,356
Oh, Secretary Go.

635
00:34:07,356 --> 00:34:12,933
I didn't just pick it up.
I bought it for you.

636
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:16,233
Thank you. It's warm.

637
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:19,067
Secretary Go, you haven't left work yet?

638
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:23,200
I suppose this is the fate
of a secretary serving the President.

639
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,667
What about you, Team Leader Bang?

640
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,367
Are you working this late?

641
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:33,500
I suppose this is the fate
of a team leader guiding a team.

642
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,333
People call me ruthless, but I enjoy working.

643
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,500
Because mistakes aren't tolerated.

644
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,000
That's admirable.

645
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,167
Not ruthless, just impressive.

646
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:46,867
This is the way I see you, Team Leader.

647
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,967
Take it.

648
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:40,796
That seems like an important call.

649
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:43,800
Completely clueless.

650
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,167
Then excuse me.

651
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:46,900
Okay.

652
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:50,433
Yes.

653
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:52,567
What? The President?

654
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,300
Why there? I just took him home.

655
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:13,067
Jeez, sober up before you leave.

656
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:15,200
You're in no condition to even take a taxi.

657
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,333
Why did you drink so much?
What if you get sick again?

658
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:21,267
I didn't want to lose.

659
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:23,667
What's so important about winning or losing?

660
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:24,700
It matters.

661
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,200
In the men's world, that's crucial.

662
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,533
Anyway, I won't disturb you. Get some rest.

663
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:36,633
I can't sleep.

664
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:39,133
Can I just stay

665
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:41,800
five more minutes?

666
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,333
Alright.

667
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:56,100
But only five minutes.

668
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:12,933
Do you remember when we met in Itaewon?

669
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:15,000
I remember.

670
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,267
How could I forget?

671
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,967
For me, that day

672
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:20,933
was really wonderful.

673
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,267
Laughing and chatting together,

674
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:26,200
drinking and playing games,

675
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,800
even running away together.

676
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:33,033
All of it felt even better

677
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:36,033
because I was with you, Ms. Jang Hui Won.

678
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:38,067
Whether I'm a boss,

679
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:41,500
an employee, or some heir,

680
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,516
just

681
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:46,167
man to man...

682
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,267
No, man to woman...

683
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:59,100
I know what you're struggling with.

684
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,400
All I can say right now is this.

685
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:08,967
I won't let you face any situation alone.

686
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:13,500
And I will absolutely never

687
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,233
let go of your hand again.

688
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,333
When did you get here?

689
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,733
Drink this, first.

690
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:31,033
It's exactly what you need right now.

691
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:34,033
Ugh, my head feels like it's splitting.

692
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:35,833
What happened last night?

693
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:38,333
Don't you remember? At all?

694
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:42,200
I don't remember anything.

695
00:39:43,233 --> 00:39:44,867
Why? Did something happen?

696
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:46,367
Pray to the heavens.

697
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,067
That's better for your mental health.

698
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:49,133
What nonsense are you talking about?

699
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:51,833
I seriously thought I was dreaming.

700
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,867
I definitely took you home last night.

701
00:39:53,867 --> 00:39:56,067
But when I came to,

702
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:58,200
I was taking you home again.

703
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,600
What kind of nonsense is this?

704
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,700
What nonsense? Seems like
you're the drunk one.

705
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,996
- Ah, my throat hurts too.
- I'm sure it does.

706
00:40:07,996 --> 00:40:09,367
[Jang Hui Won]

707
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,100
You got home safely last night, right?

708
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,433
Is your hangover any better?

709
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:15,733
What? How did she know all this?

710
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:16,900
What is all this?

711
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,767
I didn't know what you'd like.

712
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:22,567
Chicken, pizza, tteokbokki, even salad.

713
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:23,900
I can't sleep.

714
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,333
Can I just stay five more minutes?

715
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,900
I'm sorry. He kept trying to call a taxi.

716
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,767
No, this is my duty.

717
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:31,967
You should head inside.

718
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:35,533
Who are you? I haven't called a taxi yet.

719
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,400
This is a deluxe taxi,
so fares are quadruple.

720
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,767
Then I won't take it.

721
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:40,800
I'll take a regular one.

722
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,000
What do you mean?

723
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,033
- Get in quick.
- Who are you?

724
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,633
Take care now.

725
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,667
Okay, then.

726
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,567
Mister.

727
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,467
- Yes.
- Yes, then...

728
00:40:57,564 --> 00:41:00,733
Huh?

729
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:01,756
No.

730
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:04,540
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

731
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,367
You remember now?

732
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,333
Gosh, I'm so anxious.

733
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,033
Oh, you startled me.

734
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:24,124
Tastes good.

735
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:26,236
Ugh.

736
00:41:28,412 --> 00:41:30,556
Good work.

737
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:31,667
But I think...

738
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,900
I'm sorry about yesterday, in many ways.

739
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,600
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

740
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:46,333
You go on ahead.

741
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,067
See you later.

742
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,428
[OB-GYN]

743
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:01,628
[OB-GYN]
Found it through a director I know.

744
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:03,700
Call them.

745
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,300
It's a safe and reliable place.

746
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,467
Did you come here to give me this?

747
00:42:10,467 --> 00:42:12,567
If you'd answered my call,
I wouldn't have come.

748
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:15,200
Aren't you going to get rid of it anyway?

749
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,333
Mom, I'm going to keep the baby.

750
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:19,933
I told you I'm keeping this baby.

751
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:21,767
Ugh, jeez.

752
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,400
I thought

753
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,733
you came because of
the texts you sent last time.

754
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:29,100
Guess I was a fool to hope for that.

755
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:34,100
What does the baby's father do?

756
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,733
Enough. I don't want to talk about it now.

757
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,533
I'm not even curious.

758
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:40,733
Hearing about some reckless guy who got
someone else's daughter pregnant won't help.

759
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:42,767
He's not that kind of person.

760
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,300
Since when can you read people?

761
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,200
What are you going to do now?

762
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,200
Are you thinking about marriage?

763
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,933
Marriage is still...

764
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,067
No, not him, it's me.

765
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:58,500
I haven't thought that far ahead.

766
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,600
Exactly.

767
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,633
You got yourself into this mess
without planning to get married, didn't you?

768
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:05,400
Oh, my head.

769
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:08,900
I raised you wrong.

771
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,433
Fine. I won't interfere.

772
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:14,833
Whether you regret having the baby

773
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:16,767
or cry over a man,

774
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:18,700
would you even listen if I stopped you?

775
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,667
It's your life, so you handle it now.

776
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,667
I'm staying out of it.

Oh, jeez.

With the recent Taehan Liquor issues,

780
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,800
the board's mood was tense?

Oh, yes.

782
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:54,433
But it seems it's been
relatively well managed.

783
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:56,800
The stock price stabilized quickly,

784
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,000
and the board meeting went
smoothly without major disputes.

785
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
That's how it should be.

786
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,033
Du Jun isn't exactly irresponsible.

787
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:05,900
So, the thing is,

788
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,533
I've been feeling stiff
and pretty bored lately.

789
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:13,500
How about I start getting back to work?

790
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,700
- Back to work?
- Yes.

791
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,267
Why? Is it a bit too early?

792
00:44:17,267 --> 00:44:21,567
No, I'm fine with it.

793
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:24,700
I'm just concerned about your health.

794
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,500
Your heart condition,

795
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,733
and blood pressure need careful management.

796
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,500
It sounds like you're advising against it.

797
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,467
Huh? That's not it.

798
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:34,700
- What I meant was...
- Oh dear.

799
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,833
Just joking, joking.

800
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:40,633
I never knew my little brother cared
so much about my health.

801
00:44:40,633 --> 00:44:41,933
- Yes.
- Let's drink.

802
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:43,708
Yes.

803
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,116
Let's drink.

804
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:51,196
Good.

805
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,500
I expected that.

806
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,233
Don't worry. I'll speak with him.

807
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:04,600
Father-in-law.

808
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,967
If he would just stay put,
no one would get hurt.

809
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,733
He keeps bringing this on himself.

810
00:45:15,868 --> 00:45:17,633
Oh, I'm exhausted.

811
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:21,333
I shouldn't have suggested it.
I'm the only one suffering.

812
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,067
Did you get home safely yesterday?

813
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:39,800
Actually, not really.

814
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,567
- What?
- I said not really.

815
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:44,767
You're not telling me you don't remember
a single thing from yesterday, huh?

816
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:47,167
What happened yesterday?

817
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:49,500
