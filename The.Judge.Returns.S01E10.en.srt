THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:42,124
What?

3
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,084
Why is it empty?

4
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,129
Those damn bastards!

5
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:48,881
How did they hide so fast?

6
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:50,883
Hey, calm down.

7
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:54,636
Why are we searching here?
They cleared out a long time ago!

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,721
The investment scammers

9
00:00:56,263 --> 00:00:57,514
only rent this space

10
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:59,850
for investment seminars and events.

11
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:00,934
What?

12
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,401
Hey, Seong-dae invested 2.9 billion won.

13
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:10,736
It's three billion in total.

14
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:13,614
He'll catch on soon enough.
Better wrap it up.

15
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,449
I'm already on it.

16
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:16,742
I'm Seok Jeong-ho, alright?

17
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,786
You're kidding me.

18
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:21,246
I put so much effort into this case!

19
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,499
Why would you ruin it like this?

20
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:25,959
Can't believe you raided this office
without a clue!

21
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,544
Damn it.

22
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:29,546
I was tipped off, okay?

23
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,549
What a joke.

24
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:43,685
Hello?

25
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,188
There are cryptocurrency scammers
in Gangnam.

26
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:47,773
- What?
- Check the files I sent you

27
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:49,817
for further details.

THE MANAGEMENT DISAPPEARED IN 2020,
WITH 500 MILLION DOLLARS OF DAMAGE

31
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:07,459
Why did you raid this office?

32
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:10,379
They're too smart.
They must've caught on...

33
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:15,259
Hold on.

34
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,390
Yes, Mr. Lee.

35
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:23,851
Did you invest in Miracle Asia?

36
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,602
No!

37
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:43,328
What?

38
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:44,621
This can't be right.

39
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,415
Where did they all go?

40
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:48,876
Oh, no.

CEO'S OFFICE

00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,799
These frauds!

43
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:00,429
My money!

44
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:06,810
My money!

45
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:09,771
Mr. Lee

46
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:11,648
are you alright?

47
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,317
It wasn't much money, right?

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,568
How much did you invest?

49
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:18,572
You said you'd tell me!

50
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,240
And that you'd wait two months!

51
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:21,992
When did I say that?

52
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:24,244
And I wasn't behind the raid.

53
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:42,888
Yes, Mr. Kang.

54
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,806
I got a call from
the Future Talents Foundation.

55
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,101
Oh, yes.

56
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,812
Five years of making donations sounds
pretty good.

57
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,356
Send them 300 million won.

58
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,440
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:04,201
- The street angel?
- Yes, the angel.

60
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:06,453
- I'm Park Cheol-woo.
- I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

61
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,789
Nice to meet you. I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

62
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:14,211
I'll bring you the best food
to go with those drinks.

63
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:16,296
Han-young!

64
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,923
Three billion won!

65
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:19,007
Three billion...

66
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,345
You're paying me for the stage set
and my acting, right?

67
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:25,013
- Of course.
- Really?

68
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:26,723
You can't lie. You're a judge.

69
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:27,808
I wouldn't do that.

70
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,393
I'll give you all three billion won

71
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:31,478
for setting the stage and for your acting.

72
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,063
And when the time is right

73
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:35,607
donate it with a happy heart.

74
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:36,692
Hey!

75
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,111
Nothing's meaner
than taking back a present.

76
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:40,862
And nothing is better than sharing.

77
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:41,947
No!

78
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,073
You're the best.

79
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,700
No, I'm the worst!

80
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:47,244
You always let Na-yeong win, but never me.

81
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:49,705
You can stop now.
I get it. You two are best friends.

82
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:51,790
Won't Sin-jin pass out in stress

83
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:53,542
after realizing he's lost three billion?

84
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,544
It'll be over
before we even break his neck.

85
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:58,255
No, I doubt
that he'll be all that affected.

86
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:03,010
He knows he can easily earn it back
through blackmail or bribes.

87
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:04,553
What?

88
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:06,388
So, all that work was meaningless?

89
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,472
Why meaningless?

90
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,433
It united us as a team.

91
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,769
- One team!
- We now know our common enemies

92
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:15,856
and how excellent we are
at acting and thinking on our feet.

93
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:19,735
Everyone will be so shocked to hear
that the former President is

94
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:21,445
on Sin-jin's side.

95
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:23,697
- Alright, take your glasses.
- Thanks.

96
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,074
- What was that? One team?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,534
Alright, Jin-a.

98
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:28,618
For one team!

99
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:29,995
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

100
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,538
One team!

101
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,832
We're one! Yes!

102
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,545
Try this. It's a delicacy.

103
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:41,965
Hey, imagine what would've happened
had we not moved offices.

104
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:44,384
It was impossible
to get Seong-dae to leave.

105
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,886
Gosh, we were so close.

106
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,638
Hearing about that office pisses me off.

107
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,640
How could you all keep it a secret?

108
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,100
Well, I went over to help.

109
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,518
What if I didn't recognize you?

110
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:54,936
You recognized me right away.

111
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,229
All those mean words

112
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:58,023
about my driving and life!

113
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,275
Those words really came from your heart.

114
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,195
Let's just say I was creative on the spot.
It was all acting.

115
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:05,072
Ha, I doubt it.

116
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,366
Come on, stop picking on me.

117
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,494
So, what actually happened?

118
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:17,084
I tipped the prosecution
about Miracle Asia.

119
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:20,045
What? The prosecution?

120
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:22,297
We need the prosecution to raid the office

121
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,300
for the case to be dismissed
without Seong-dae realizing who got him.

122
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,386
Hey

123
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:32,432
how am I supposed to know
the prosecution is coming?

124
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,601
On that note

125
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,562
let's set up another office.

126
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:42,359
Man, I knew you were smart!

127
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:47,280
MIRACLE ASIA HEADQUARTERS ADDRESS

128
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,699
They moved offices already?

129
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:53,537
Classic scammer move.

130
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:54,996
Sure.

131
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,832
Headquarters or not

132
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,959
as long as they make my money grow.

133
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:01,920
You knew it, didn't you?

134
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,004
No!

135
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:06,174
It's my first time hearing about it.

136
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,593
Wow, your acting is on point!

137
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:14,558
What is this?
It's not a restaurant nor a food stand.

138
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,018
What is this?

139
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,645
Hello!

140
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:20,355
- Hello!
- Hey.

141
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,023
- Here.
- Hello.

142
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,108
- Thank you.
- Sit here.

143
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:24,484
- Thank you.
- She's...

144
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:26,778
How are you?

145
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,990
Hello, I'm Song Na-yeon.

146
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:33,493
Hello, I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

147
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:35,912
Hi, I'm Song Na-yeon.

148
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,372
What's with that voice?

149
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,624
Have a seat.

150
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,834
Here.

151
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,836
I cooked this squid stir-fry.

152
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,546
- Wow!
- Have a glass.

153
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:47,299
Thank you.

154
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:32,052
You can beg me all you want

155
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:34,554
and I'd still never eat there.

156
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,936
But why do I want to cry?

157
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,270
This is so annoying!

158
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:09,214
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

160
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,844
What the hell is this?

161
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:17,639
You said you'd sort it out.
You told me to trust you!

162
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,644
Did I ever say I couldn't sort it out?

163
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,023
So, what's your plan now?

164
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:29,526
Forget becoming the Chief Justice.

165
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,903
My son is about to make me lose
my Justice title!

166
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,949
Your son's trial will be over soon

167
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,451
and you'll become the Chief Justice.

168
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:41,413
Are you

169
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:43,582
really sure about this?

170
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,586
The trial was unexpected

171
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,963
but that won't change anything.

172
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,259
You're sure about this?

173
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,761
But

174
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:00,515
now that it'll take more effort

175
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:04,644
with your son's unexpected case

176
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:09,274
you'll need to give me what I want.

177
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,994
Justice Hwang's son's life is

178
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:22,996
right in your hands.

179
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,291
It's like you won the lottery.

180
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:32,047
Justice Hwang's son's life is in my hands

181
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,132
but nobody's approached me yet.

182
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,134
As if

183
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:38,261
someone is stopping them.

184
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,144
You cast the bait yourself

185
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,272
so hunt him yourself, too.

186
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:52,275
Tae-seong isn't a bait.
He's being held hostage.

187
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:02,035
I'm not conducting a trial.

188
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:03,620
It's a hostage situation.

189
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,539
The record of your illegal funds

190
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,458
when you worked
for the National Election Commission.

191
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,252
Bring that to me.

192
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,221
I don't know what you're talking about.

193
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,938
Do you really not know?

194
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:31,356
No, I don't.

195
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:38,029
So, you're choosing to be
a heartless father.

196
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,033
By the way

197
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,037
your son will receive
the maximum sentence possible.

198
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,756
You don't think I can stop a junior judge
with a single call

199
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,050
with my huge networks?

200
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,261
Sorry.

201
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,972
That newbie judge only listens to me.

202
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:08,852
Haven't you made enough calls already?

203
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:13,523
You must know

204
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:17,360
you have zero power over your son's trial

205
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,654
pretty well by now.

206
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:28,413
Anyway, I got your message.

207
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,294
Regardless of the trial

208
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,380
I'll make you the Chief Justice.

209
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:40,175
The file exposes

210
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:43,011
not only multiple assemblymen

211
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:46,473
but also the illegal funds
for the former and current Presidents.

212
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,560
You sure you can handle that?

213
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,192
I wouldn't have bitten off

214
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,527
what I couldn't chew.

215
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:15,585
Justice Hwang.

216
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:41,194
The court hereby orders

217
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:43,029
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

218
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,407
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

219
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:49,285
Hwang Nam-yong.

220
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,378
I don't care what you give Sin-jin.

221
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,965
You'll never become the Chief Justice.

222
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,176
I'll do everything it takes to stop you

223
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,345
even if you were to sell your soul.

224
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,519
Why haven't you sent the money

225
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:15,895
to the Future Talents Foundation?

226
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:21,276
I think we should re-negotiate
on the donation period.

227
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,736
No, a five-year donation period
isn't a bad deal.

228
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:25,697
Right.

229
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,493
Is something wrong?

230
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:36,040
- Mr. Kang.
- Tell me.

231
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:41,129
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,882
I've been scammed.

233
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:47,176
What?

234
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,599
I invested some money
into an Asian cryptocurrency scam

235
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:56,144
and the prosecution ruined my plan
by suddenly raiding them.

236
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:58,104
I had no idea.

237
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:00,732
You invested your money,
knowing it was a scam?

238
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,692
Yes. But...

239
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,403
Prosecutor Park promised a heads-up

240
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:06,487
before raiding them

241
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,531
so I thought it'd be safe.

242
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,284
But someone unexpected came along...

243
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:12,368
That's enough.

244
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:14,579
How much did you lose?

245
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,962
All three billion won.

246
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:26,925
You've really lost your mind.

247
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:28,718
I can find them.

248
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:31,220
Prosecutor Park has been investigating

249
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,513
so I know he'll find them.

250
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:38,603
So?

251
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:41,064
What if they do get arrested?

252
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,905
What will you tell the prosecution?

253
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:01,417
How will you explain
where you got the three billion won?

254
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:09,801
That I gave it to you?

255
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:31,197
I'll do everything to get the money back.

256
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,490
No!

257
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,252
Don't bother doing anything.

258
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,683
Stay low and invisible

259
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,686
until I call you.

260
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:04,731
Just stay alive.

261
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,456
I'm ready.

262
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,334
HWANG NAM-YONG

263
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:28,129
I'll send the judge
on your son's case tomorrow.

264
00:17:33,926 --> 00:17:36,554
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

265
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,677
You called me?

266
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:21,557
Meet up with Nam-yong.

267
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:22,642
He has something for you.

268
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:23,768
Yes, sir.

269
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:26,938
And here.

270
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:31,567
What's this?

271
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,405
So, you're the judge on the case.

272
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:19,282
I've seen you at the Central Court.

273
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,535
Yes, I've only briefly introduced myself.

274
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:23,786
Is that right?

275
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:26,747
I'm sure you know Tae-seong is my son.

276
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:29,292
How do you plan on closing the case?

277
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:31,627
What do you mean, sir?

278
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:34,380
I guess you haven't heard yet.

279
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,549
I'll tell you now, then.

280
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:39,427
Announce Tae-seong as not guilty.

281
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:42,054
Let's say he was misled

282
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,432
to think his teaching assistantship
and internship

283
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:45,892
counted as work experience.

284
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:50,396
I'll be forever grateful
once you close the case well.

285
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:52,273
And

286
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:57,403
make sure to pass this on to Sin-jin.

287
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:05,244
If it's about the final verdict,
I've already heard about your history.

288
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:08,122
I hear you wrote the verdict yourself
last time.

289
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,290
If that's what you want

290
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:11,876
I'll happily go to that length for you.

291
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,212
Could you please write one this time, too?

292
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:15,880
Sure.

293
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,882
I just need a few days to write it.

294
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:20,509
A person who injures the credit of another
by circulating false facts

295
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:22,261
or through fraudulent means

296
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:23,804
shall be punished by imprisonment with
labor for less than five years

297
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,890
or by a fine not exceeding 15 million won.

298
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:29,101
What do you think you're doing?

299
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:32,146
Just wanted to help you write the verdict.

300
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,192
Tae-seong lied about his work experience
to apply for the job at JB

301
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:37,526
which is fraudulent

302
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,445
and an obstruction of business

303
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:41,113
for disrupting JB's hiring process.

304
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:47,119
A son of a Justice should be
an inspiring example to society, not this.

305
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:51,832
I'd say a year and a half in prison
sounds about right.

306
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,127
What the hell are you going on about?

307
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:56,837
You even used your authority

308
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,632
to make JB forge Tae-seong's scores
so he could be hired.

309
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:01,467
Since the public despises

310
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,387
anyone using their powerful dads
for their own success

311
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,846
he'll have to serve

312
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,140
a year and a half without exceptions.

313
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:12,228
You think you can continue being a judge
after pulling this?

314
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,941
You're the one who should end
your career in court.

315
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:18,776
What?

316
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:22,905
How dare you blackmail a Justice?

317
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:31,831
How dare you?

318
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:48,973
Tae-seong will serve

319
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:50,808
exactly a year and a half in jail.

320
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:52,476
What?

321
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:08,784
HWANG NAM-YONG'S TRANSACTION RECORDS
FOR ALL BRIBES RECEIVED

This was over a decade ago.

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,042
How do you have this?

I WAS BORN ON OCTOBER 22, 1964,

00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:37,146
MY BOSS IS VERY STRONG. HE PROTECTED ME

334
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:40,274
INVESTIGATION RECORD, CONFIDENTIAL

335
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,402
You took bribes
from Mr. Jang Tae-sik of S Construction

336
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:47,031
and ruled in favor of a con man
who staged his injury.

337
00:22:48,824 --> 00:22:51,452
What a verdict needs is
justice and common sense.

338
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,037
But you framed

339
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,706
Plaintiff Lee Bong-seok as the perpetrator

340
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:58,125
and sentenced him
to a year and a half in jail.

341
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,170
Your verdict

342
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:04,131
robbed a family

343
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:06,425
of its father

344
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:09,595
and husband.

345
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:15,976
Who are you?

346
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:18,479
Don't tell me...

347
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:19,855
That's right.

348
00:23:21,982 --> 00:23:24,318
The son who had his father robbed
for a year and a half

349
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:27,780
all because of you.

350
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:39,333
So...

351
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:43,462
you want an apology from me now?

352
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:47,550
What's the point in getting an apology?

353
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,052
When you won't even be sincere.

354
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:51,303
That's right.

355
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:52,638
But you're the same.

356
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:55,182
All that talk about justice

357
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,685
yet what you want on my son's verdict is

358
00:23:58,144 --> 00:23:59,728
revenge, not justice.

359
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:03,524
It doesn't matter if I get fired
or my son ends up in jail.

360
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:06,277
What difference does that make for you?

361
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:09,697
I don't know if you know it yet

362
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,657
but I'm the next Chief Justice.

363
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,075
So

364
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:15,619
let past stay in the past

365
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:18,247
and move on to the future with me.

366
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,167
I'll compensate you for the past
well enough.

367
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:25,463
I'm more curious about the present.

368
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:30,301
I'm not sure
if what I want is revenge or justice.

369
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:31,844
But in this moment

370
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:34,889
I just can't stand the fact

371
00:24:34,972 --> 00:24:36,265
that someone like you

372
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:39,059
has power and authority in court.

373
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:48,527
Think about how far I can get you

374
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:51,697
once I become the Chief Justice.

375
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:54,116
Seize the chance

376
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:56,160
when you can.

377
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:00,789
I'm the one giving you a chance.

378
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,544
Start by retiring as a judge.
It doesn't suit you.

379
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:09,715
That's the only way
your son will return home.

380
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,603
You have no idea
how badly I wanted to kill you.

381
00:25:47,503 --> 00:25:49,797
A writer once asked himself

382
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:54,468
"Can the past help the present?"

383
00:25:58,097 --> 00:25:59,723
And here's what I want to ask myself.

384
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:02,643
Can myself from my past life

385
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:05,145
help me in the present?

386
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:09,858
Am I still making the right choices

387
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:11,860
for the better future?

388
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:18,367
COURT

389
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:21,453
Did you assign Judge Lee

390
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:23,831
for my son's case on purpose?

391
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,376
As unfortunate as it is for you

392
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:30,170
I guess karma is a real thing.

393
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:32,798
What about the documents?

394
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:35,801
Did you write them?

395
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:38,971
I was

396
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:41,098
your assistant judge then.

397
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:43,267
You took bribes from defendants

398
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,394
and colluded with them all the time.

399
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,313
So, you go behind my back like this?

400
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:50,107
There's not even anything in it for you.

401
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:52,484
Because truth can also be powerful

402
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:53,986
though that's rarely the case.

403
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:00,784
You struck me for no reason.

404
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:04,371
Do you realize
what your little punch has caused?

405
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:07,416
That rascal told me to end my career!

406
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:08,500
Otherwise, he insisted

407
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:11,170
he'd sentence my son to jail
for a year and a half!

408
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:14,465
That's interesting.

409
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:17,885
Regardless of what Judge Lee told you

410
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,678
you'll become the Chief Justice.

411
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:22,306
And your son will also be home soon.

412
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:23,390
What?

413
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:26,810
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

414
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:28,020
I'm not joking.

415
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,939
Think about all the wrongs you've done.

416
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:33,734
This is just a small price to pay.

417
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:39,281
So

418
00:27:40,074 --> 00:27:42,618
is this really the end of it?

419
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:45,496
But Judge Lee is still the judge
on the case.

420
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:47,665
Words have power.

421
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:50,584
Whose words do you think have more power

422
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:53,379
Judge Lee's or mine?

423
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:10,896
You'd better own up

424
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:14,108
to what you just said.

425
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:36,755
I apologize.

426
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,426
What? For what?

427
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:43,887
For Seong-dae.

428
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:46,140
I knew he was into investing

429
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:48,600
but I had no idea
he'd do something so ridiculous.

430
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:50,894
I should've watched him more closely.

431
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:54,606
How's that your fault?

432
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,068
It's my fault for leaving money
with such an idiot.

433
00:29:00,863 --> 00:29:01,905
No.

434
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:04,241
I'll work even harder

435
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:06,201
so you don't run into more problems.

436
00:29:07,202 --> 00:29:08,203
Okay.

437
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:11,457
Let's just move on.
Don't make it a bigger issue.

438
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:13,959
We're making the Chief Justice here.

439
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,546
Three billion won isn't worth
jeopardizing that.

440
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:20,758
Cheers.

441
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:42,404
The only ones who knew
Seong-dae had three billion won were

442
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:44,364
you, me

443
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,700
and Han-young.

444
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,411
Sorry? What do you mean?

445
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:53,081
We have to see

446
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,251
what Han-young is really like.

447
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:10,390
So, did you bring it?

448
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,818
Did you check the file?

449
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:22,194
No, sir.

450
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:28,575
You must be dying to know
what Nam-yong is handing over to me.

451
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:32,871
I figured you'd tell me
if it was something I needed to know.

452
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,837
There are some impressive devices
these days.

453
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,635
If you accessed this file

454
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:48,762
I'll be able to see it.

455
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:55,227
ALLOW DEVICE TO CONNECT

456
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,146
RECORD OF ILLEGAL FUNDS

457
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,943
ILLEGAL FUNDS FOR FORMER PRESIDENTS

458
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:09,783

FOR FORMER PRESIDENT PARK GWANG-TO

459
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:15,414

FILES COPIED: 0 TIMES

461
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:35,392
You're awfully obedient for a young man.

462
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:40,105
If I were you,
I would've opened it out of curiosity.

463
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:44,192
Let me pour you one.

464
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:04,630
Yes, Ms. Song.

465
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:06,506
I talked to an expert

466
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,592
and you'll be really screwed
if you open it.

467
00:32:08,675 --> 00:32:11,178
It tracks all the times
the files are accessed and copied.

468
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:12,971
You'd better not do anything with it.

469
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:24,066
There's a first for everything.

470
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:28,070
That's where your initial resolve lies.

471
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:31,198
Here.

472
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:36,620
I'm walking on thin ice

473
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:37,996
to gain Sin-jin's trust.

474
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:42,626
One slip, and it's game over.

475
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,631
But so many forget
about their first resolves.

476
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:50,217
But that's

477
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:52,260
none of my business.

478
00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:53,887
You know why?

479
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,764
Because you have

480
00:32:56,723 --> 00:32:58,934
endless people wanting to be on your side.

481
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:03,063
Exactly.

482
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:06,191
So, don't forget yours.

483
00:33:42,227 --> 00:33:43,603
Hey, welcome back.

484
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,063
Thanks. Where's Mother?

485
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:47,232
She's asleep. She said she was tired.

486
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:57,409
- Father.
- Yeah?

487
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,620
Why don't I join you for a drink?
It's been a while.

488
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:01,705
Sure.

489
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:30,192
Oh, I was just going to have one glass.

490
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:34,321
Wow.

491
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:58,345
Here.

492
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,110
Father.

493
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:14,528
Yeah?

494
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:19,616
I was

495
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:22,202
there.

496
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:28,416
I can't stop thinking about it.

497
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:29,960
When you were protesting

498
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:32,170
against the redevelopment.

499
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:34,047
Why are you still stuck on that?

500
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,632
You should forget about it.

501
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:46,351
- When you passed out...
- Forget about it all.

502
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,106
Whatever it is, just forget about it.

503
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:57,195
Are you okay?

504
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:59,030
Don't come this way! Stop!

505
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:01,158
Don't hurt us!

506
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:04,327
Father?

507
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:07,789
No!

508
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:12,919
Father!

509
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,570
Even the stones on the ground have
their own stories.

510
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:41,156
And even the newest newborns have

511
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,992
as many stories as the days they've lived.

512
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:45,452
So

513
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:48,246
in a world of endless stories intertwined
with each other

514
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,582
who doesn't feel wronged or blamed?

515
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,793
If you stay stuck on feeling wronged

516
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:57,380
how can your heart embrace

517
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:02,135
the more important emotions
that it should feel?

518
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:08,516
People don't say they're fine

519
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,019
because they're really fine.

520
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:13,563
So

521
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,274
whatever is going on inside of you

522
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:20,320
just keep telling yourself it's fine

523
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:23,823
and it'll all be fine one day.

524
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:46,763
I like my eggs

525
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:49,683
sunny-side-up.

526
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:53,311
Don't break the yolk.

527
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,734
Thanks.

528
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,348
It's fine.

529
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,601
It's fine.

530
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:34,894
I'm sorry.

531
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:44,070
I'm sorry.

532
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:47,115
How much time do I have?

533
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:50,994
I just want to live like this

534
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:53,538
until the end.

535
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:14,309
Oh, gosh.

536
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:18,688
Stop drinking before bed.

537
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:27,989
You remember that girl?

538
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:31,910
The one we met
shortly after I was released from jail.

539
00:39:33,286 --> 00:39:34,579
Of course.

540
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:36,581
How can I forget about her?

541
00:39:45,006 --> 00:39:46,007
Hello?

542
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,343
Do you need help?

543
00:39:48,426 --> 00:39:49,844
Did your mom tell you to come?

544
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,557
Oh, I...

545
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:57,185
Well...

546
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:07,779
Here you go.

547
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,661
What's this?

548
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:17,038
I'm sorry.

549
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,290
- Hey!
- Miss!

550
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,794
Oh, well...

551
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:25,422
My dad isn't a bad man.

552
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:29,050
Please don't resent him so much.

553
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:34,347
Hey...

554
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:44,983
Hello

555
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:46,818
my name is Kim Jin-a.

556
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:48,862
I'm the daughter of Kim Seok-tae

557
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:51,156
the man whom you supposedly beat up

558
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,866
and sued you.

559
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,911
I know you didn't do anything wrong.

560
00:40:57,328 --> 00:40:59,080
Of course, I also know

561
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:01,040
you didn't hurt my dad.

562
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:04,669
My dad isn't a bad man

563
00:41:04,752 --> 00:41:07,464
but he did something bad
so he could raise me.

564
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:08,923
I'd love to tell my dad

565
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,843
to stop working in such an evil job

566
00:41:11,926 --> 00:41:14,179
but I've been pretending
not to know about his job

567
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:17,807
because I don't want to break his heart.

568
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:21,227
My Jin-a.

569
00:41:23,188 --> 00:41:25,064
You're a real grown-up,
like everyone else.

570
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:29,444
Of course.

571
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,280
I even work late nights

572
00:41:32,697 --> 00:41:34,032
and have staff dinners.

573
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:40,455
You've never had those, have you?

574
00:41:40,747 --> 00:41:43,249
Are you asking if I'm jealous?

575
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:46,836
Are you?

576
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:51,549
Of course.

577
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:53,885
I'm so, so jealous.

578
00:41:58,598 --> 00:41:59,599
Here.

579
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,685
Apparently, this brings you luck.

580
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,396
Broke people like us

581
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,524
have nothing but luck to count on.

582
00:42:08,149 --> 00:42:10,026
So, every time I saw a four-leaf clover

583
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:11,778
I made sure to pluck it.

584
00:42:12,487 --> 00:42:13,738
But now that I see it

585
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:18,201
having you as my daughter was
my biggest luck.

586
00:42:18,993 --> 00:42:20,286
You're my Ace of Clubs.

587
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:25,917
The four-leaf clover in this letter is

588
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,127
what my dad and I love most.

589
00:42:28,753 --> 00:42:30,588
Dad said we had to wish for luck

590
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:32,382
because we had nothing else to count on.

591
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,884
That's why he loves these clovers so much.

592
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:38,012
A four-leaf clover may be the only thing

593
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:39,847
I can give you now

594
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:41,683
but once I grow older

595
00:42:41,766 --> 00:42:43,685
I'll compensate you
for my dad's wrongdoing.

596
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:45,812
I'm so sorry.

597
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:48,147
Sincerely, Kim Seok-tae's daughter,
Kim Jin-a.

598
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:52,569
Her name was

599
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:56,447
Jin-a, right? Kim Jin-a?

600
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:57,782
Yeah.

601
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,993
She asked us to forgive her dad.

602
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:03,037
She wrote that he was doing bad things
to raise her

603
00:43:03,913 --> 00:43:06,749
but he wasn't a bad man.

604
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:10,962
How does that make any sense, though?

605
00:43:14,716 --> 00:43:15,800
You know

606
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:19,721
we should've at least fed her a meal
before she left.

607
00:43:22,724 --> 00:43:24,100
I hope she's doing fine.

608
00:43:24,726 --> 00:43:26,144
I sure do, too.

609
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:46,956
Are you Mr. Kim Seok-tae's guardian?

610
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:58,468
I urgently called you earlier

611
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:00,511
because he was having breathing issues

612
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:02,597
but I should've waited a bit first.

613
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,265
Sorry for calling you so late.

614
00:44:22,825 --> 00:44:23,868
Interesting.

615
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:27,205
I swear I've seen him somewhere.

616
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,251
Call her right now.

617
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:35,004
Yes, sir.

618
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,633
Ms. Kim.

619
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:41,135
Ms. Kim!

620
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:42,512
Ms. Kim!

621
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:43,888
Ms. Kim!

622
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:46,224
You can't do this!

623
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:50,770
I won't say anything

624
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:53,481
about you guys having moved him
to a different room

625
00:44:53,564 --> 00:44:54,941
without my permission.

626
00:44:57,026 --> 00:44:58,778
- Sorry?
- Tell me

627
00:44:58,861 --> 00:44:59,946
how much the VIP suite costs.

628
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:01,656
Oh, sure.

629
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:19,757
Damn, that's fresh.

630
00:45:20,258 --> 00:45:21,509
Why don't you move your dad

631
00:45:22,301 --> 00:45:23,970
back to the VIP suite?

632
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:27,014
I'll take care
of your father's hospital bills

633
00:45:27,098 --> 00:45:30,017
and all the money you need

634
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:31,728
to maintain your status.

635
00:45:32,603 --> 00:45:34,981
Are you using money to win love

636
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:36,482
because the letter didn't work?

637
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:39,902
What you're doing is

638
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:41,571
disrespecting your father.

639
00:45:41,988 --> 00:45:44,741
Byeon, what did the doctor say?

640
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:48,035
It's Chronic...

641
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:50,955
It's Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.

642
00:45:51,038 --> 00:45:53,708
Yeah. What causes that?

643
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,752
Repetitive concussion

644
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:57,795
and head injuries.

645
00:45:58,546 --> 00:45:59,839
I see.

646
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:05,887
That's interesting for a man
with a successful prosecutor daughter.

647
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,640
What kind of a life did he possibly live
that led up to that?

648
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:14,645
He might as well have joined a gang

649
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:16,314
if he wanted to get his head smashed.

650
00:46:16,397 --> 00:46:18,816
Maybe he was one of them,
just at the very bottom?

651
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:20,860
Watch it.

652
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:23,571
Oh, sorry.

653
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:32,955
PATIENT: KIM SEOK-TAE

654
00:46:34,665 --> 00:46:35,666
Dad!

655
00:46:39,962 --> 00:46:41,297
My gosh.

656
00:46:42,757 --> 00:46:43,883
Are you okay?

657
00:46:43,966 --> 00:46:44,967
Yeah, I'm fine.

658
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:49,555
What do we do?

659
00:46:52,475 --> 00:46:53,684
Oh, gosh.

660
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:08,074
Good work.

661
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:21,963
You know

662
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,509
this is at least 100 times healthier

663
00:47:26,926 --> 00:47:29,136
than the raw liver last time.

664
00:47:35,142 --> 00:47:36,227
You become mine

665
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:38,938
if you drink this, okay?

666
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:43,860
I'm just kidding.

667
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:44,986
Drink it

668
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:47,238
and all of this is yours.

669
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,324
You hold quite a grudge.

670
00:47:50,658 --> 00:47:52,034
Of course.

671
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:54,829
There's nothing I hate
more than people who pretend to be chill.

672
00:47:56,581 --> 00:47:57,623
So, what now?

673
00:47:57,999 --> 00:47:59,500
Are you trying to befriend me now?

674
00:47:59,584 --> 00:48:00,626
Well

675
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,838
I'd love to have such a pretty prosecutor
be my friend, of course.

676
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:26,444
You know, I love oysters

677
00:48:28,362 --> 00:48:31,699
but the ones from you are too fishy.

678
00:48:41,709 --> 00:48:44,170
I appreciate you keeping me entertained

679
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:49,634
but be a little patient.
Stop pestering me.

680
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:51,719
I'll come soon enough.

681
00:48:57,892 --> 00:48:58,976
Okay.

682
00:49:00,394 --> 00:49:02,063
But don't take too long.

683
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:04,273
I hate being bored

684
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,400
as much as you do.

685
00:49:23,042 --> 00:49:25,670
CALL HISTORY

686
00:49:25,753 --> 00:49:27,296
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE
TAKES HIS OWN LIFE AT HIS OFFICE

687
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,589
INVESTIGATION ON CHU YONG-JIN
TO BE INTERRUPTED

688
00:49:29,882 --> 00:49:31,759
I've confirmed everything about Haenal

689
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:34,053
S Group's case, and the other case.

690
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:36,389
My guess was right about them all.

691
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:38,933
But there's no conclusive evidence yet.

692
00:49:39,016 --> 00:49:40,434
The same goes with this.

693
00:49:43,771 --> 00:49:45,690
Sin-jin...

694
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:47,900
Why do you think

695
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:51,320
Han-young left this with you?

696
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,543
We'll know once he tells us.

697
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:10,297
Is all of this true?

698
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:12,466
Yes, based on everything I know.

699
00:50:13,217 --> 00:50:15,886
I'm sure he's done more evil things
that I don't know about.

700
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,973
Since when did you know about Sin-jin?

701
00:50:19,056 --> 00:50:20,182
When I found

702
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:22,977
the draft dodger list
at my parents' junkyard.

703
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,061
Once I realized

704
00:50:24,145 --> 00:50:25,938
Sin-jin was the one going after that list

705
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,273
I kept digging into him.

706
00:50:27,648 --> 00:50:29,650
I knew it
when you busted that serial killer

707
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:31,485
in Chungcheongnam-do.

708
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:34,864
Why are you acting like a prosecutor?
You're a judge!

709
00:50:34,947 --> 00:50:37,992
And you should've come to me first
when you got this.

710
00:50:39,535 --> 00:50:41,954
I needed to gain Sin-jin's trust first.

711
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,205
And get a new car from him?

712
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:45,875
I told you I paid for that
with a 60-month installment plan!

713
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:47,543
- But it was so sudden.
- So?

714
00:50:47,793 --> 00:50:49,128
Life happens, okay?

715
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:51,630
I'm already...

716
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:53,674
Yes, sir.

717
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,261
In fact

718
00:50:57,803 --> 00:51:00,139
we're also conducting
an internal investigation on him.

719
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:03,809
- Sorry?
- Sin-jin has a bad reputation.

720
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:07,605
But nobody dares to check
if the rumors are true.

721
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,523
It's as if messing with Sin-jin is

722
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:11,567
doing the unfathomable.

723
00:51:13,694 --> 00:51:14,862
Tell me

724
00:51:15,362 --> 00:51:18,741
the real reason I need to become
the Chief Justice.

725
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:19,867
Sorry?

726
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,369
It's you again?

727
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:24,288
Is this about Sin-jin?

728
00:51:25,372 --> 00:51:26,373
Yes, sir.

729
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:29,210
I need the Chief Justice to have my back

730
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:31,504
in order for me to take on Sin-jin.

731
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:34,048
I see.

732
00:51:35,132 --> 00:51:36,342
Are you crazy?

733
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:37,885
- How dare you...
- But

734
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:40,513
Sin-jin isn't the final boss here.

735
00:51:42,515 --> 00:51:45,392
We had an idea
when we began the internal investigation.

736
00:51:47,728 --> 00:51:48,896
Do you know

737
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:51,816
who has his back?

738
00:52:16,048 --> 00:52:19,051
This looks like a bag full of money.

739
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:22,847
Do you know who runs Suojae?

740
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:23,931
Sorry?

741
00:52:25,057 --> 00:52:26,058
I'm not sure.

742
00:52:27,768 --> 00:52:29,895
Park Gwang-to, the former President.

743
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:48,873
This is Baek Yi-seok.

744
00:52:48,956 --> 00:52:50,749
Hello, Mr. Baek.

745
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,086
Are you confident about nominating me

746
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,296
as the next Chief Justice?

747
00:52:55,379 --> 00:52:57,006
Have you made up your mind?

748
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:00,718
Yes, please go ahead with it.

749
00:53:06,307 --> 00:53:07,308
Sure.

750
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:12,188
I'll gladly watch
this audacious rookie's back.

751
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,275
Thank you, sir!

752
00:53:16,775 --> 00:53:21,864
PRESIDING JUDGE KIM JIN-HAN

753
00:53:21,947 --> 00:53:24,074
CALL HISTORY

754
00:53:26,952 --> 00:53:28,162
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

755
00:53:29,496 --> 00:53:30,748
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

756
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,170
Judge Lee...

757
00:53:37,296 --> 00:53:38,547
And Prosecutor Park?

758
00:53:39,506 --> 00:53:41,467
Lee Han-young and Park Cheol-woo...

759
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,180
There's definitely something going on.

760
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:05,324
MR.KANG: KILL HWANG TAE-SEONG
AND STAGE IT AS A SUICIDE

761
00:54:05,616 --> 00:54:06,784
CALL HISTORY

762
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:11,997
This is Prosecutor Park's call history

763
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:13,791
the day you blew three billion won.

764
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:16,794
- Prosecutor Park?
- Yeah.

765
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:19,755
You overheard Prosecutor Kim on the phone
in the hallway

766
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:22,132
and ran into Prosecutor Park
at the golf driving range?

767
00:54:22,716 --> 00:54:23,717
That may not be

768
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,928
a coincidence.

769
00:54:27,888 --> 00:54:28,889
Then...

770
00:54:31,016 --> 00:54:32,017
Look into it.

771
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:34,561
Yes, sir.

772
00:54:35,562 --> 00:54:37,982
What do I tell Mr. Kang, though?

773
00:54:40,484 --> 00:54:42,361
He told you to do nothing but stay alive.

774
00:54:45,906 --> 00:54:48,826
Don't get on his nerves.
He doesn't have time for that.

775
00:54:49,952 --> 00:54:51,036
Yes, sir.

776
00:54:51,328 --> 00:54:54,248
Why do you keep coming to me?
You love risking your life, anyway.

777
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:59,128
The universe may decide when I live or die

778
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:02,172
but the Presidential election is soon.

779
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:05,592
Who becomes the next leader is
up to the people.

780
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:07,136
Exactly.

781
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:09,138
Here.

782
00:55:10,514 --> 00:55:12,016
Who's going to win?

783
00:55:13,142 --> 00:55:15,519
It's one or the other, anyway.

784
00:55:15,602 --> 00:55:16,603
Why so confused?

785
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:18,981
The public opinion polls keep changing.

786
00:55:19,064 --> 00:55:20,816
I can't predict anything.

787
00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:23,736
Gosh, old man.

788
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:27,865
You talk like a gentleman,
but order me around like a maid.

789
00:55:29,408 --> 00:55:30,451
Here.

790
00:55:45,758 --> 00:55:46,884
This one.

791
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,136
He'll take the jewel and rise.

792
00:55:53,474 --> 00:55:55,517
KIM YUN-CHEOL
OF THE DAEHAN CENTRAL PARTY

793
00:55:56,143 --> 00:55:58,520
Kim Yun-cheol from the ruling party?

794
00:55:58,604 --> 00:56:00,856
Having no change of government sounds

795
00:56:01,398 --> 00:56:02,900
like the best scenario possible.

796
00:56:35,057 --> 00:56:36,558
Damn it, he's awake.

797
00:57:03,627 --> 00:57:04,878
I got it done.

798
00:57:05,796 --> 00:57:06,797
Good work.

799
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:22,688
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

800
00:57:27,234 --> 00:57:30,154
This contains all records of illegal funds
for the new assemblymen

801
00:57:30,237 --> 00:57:33,782
and the former and the current Presidents
from the last election.

802
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:36,368
Including Mr. Park Gwang-to,
the former President.

803
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,292
Are you surprised?

804
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:47,546
Yes, sir.

805
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:50,632
Illegal funds

806
00:57:50,716 --> 00:57:52,968
for the former and current Presidents...

807
00:57:55,554 --> 00:57:56,889
What a kid.

808
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,017
You thought Presidents would do better?

809
00:58:01,685 --> 00:58:04,938
Nam-yong took these files
while in the National Election Commission.

810
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:09,443
I could only get my hands on them
because you kept his son captive.

811
00:58:12,029 --> 00:58:13,238
I knew it.

812
00:58:15,532 --> 00:58:16,700
So, Tae-seong

813
00:58:17,242 --> 00:58:18,535
was not a bait

814
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:20,954
but was being held captive.

815
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:24,583
Are you disappointed
I didn't tell you sooner?

816
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:32,799
No, sir.

817
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:35,636
I'll get to end Nam-yong's career

818
00:58:36,094 --> 00:58:38,847
and you've become more powerful
with those files

819
00:58:38,931 --> 00:58:40,182
so I'm glad.

820
00:58:43,435 --> 00:58:44,436
That's right.

821
00:58:45,604 --> 00:58:48,148
How it ends always matters
more than the way there.

822
00:58:55,656 --> 00:58:57,908
I want to share this power with you.

823
00:58:59,493 --> 00:59:00,494
What do you say?

824
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:05,499
It's a chance
to join the real power circle.

825
00:59:10,879 --> 00:59:12,005
He means the Suojae.

826
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,178
Everyone, please rise.

827
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:31,149
Announce Tae-seong as not guilty.

828
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:35,279
You want to join the real power circle

829
00:59:35,362 --> 00:59:37,030
the shadow government that runs Korea?

830
00:59:37,114 --> 00:59:38,907
This is just a small entry fee for that.

831
00:59:45,998 --> 00:59:47,666
Everyone, please be seated.

832
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:54,590
DEFENDANT

833
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:57,259
JUDGE

834
00:59:57,342 --> 00:59:58,343
Where's the Defendant?

835
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,472
Sorry, Your Honor.
I can't reach him right now

836
01:00:02,556 --> 01:00:04,057
but he should be here any minute.

837
01:00:12,941 --> 01:00:14,901
JUDGE

838
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:21,742
It's been ten minutes now.

839
01:00:22,534 --> 01:00:23,869
Do we need to wait any longer?

840
01:00:24,494 --> 01:00:25,871
Sorry about that.

841
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:54,816
Tae-seong is holding a press conference.

842
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,276
- Right now?
- You sure?

843
01:01:01,406 --> 01:01:02,824
In the past life

844
01:01:02,908 --> 01:01:05,744
Tae-seong took his own life
with a letter claiming his innocence

845
01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:08,205
which made the public turn
from cold to empathetic.

846
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:09,790
And Nam-yong, who'd lost his son

847
01:01:09,873 --> 01:01:11,291
became the Chief Justice.

848
01:01:25,764 --> 01:01:26,765
I knew

849
01:01:27,641 --> 01:01:29,851
I was faking my work experience

850
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:33,105
yet still included
my teaching assistantship and internship

851
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:37,234
as work experience
on my application to JB Daehan.

852
01:01:38,026 --> 01:01:41,196
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR HWANG TAE-SEONG
AND HIS UNFAIR HIRING ALLEGATIONS

853
01:01:42,072 --> 01:01:43,073
I apologize.

854
01:01:46,993 --> 01:01:49,079
I'm Gong Hyeon-do of Yujeong Daily.

855
01:01:49,162 --> 01:01:50,414
When did you submit

856
01:01:50,497 --> 01:01:52,749
your application to JB Daehan?

857
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:56,545
I was tipped off
that you applied after the deadline.

858
01:01:58,422 --> 01:01:59,589
I submitted it to the HR

859
01:02:00,632 --> 01:02:02,217
after getting hired.

860
01:02:05,137 --> 01:02:06,847
Tae-seong!

861
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:29,411
Tae-seong!

862
01:02:29,578 --> 01:02:30,579
Tae-seong!

863
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:43,842
Darn it.

864
01:02:44,968 --> 01:02:45,969
Yeah.

865
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:48,430
I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

866
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,110
Sin-jin will try to kill Tae-seong.

867
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:03,361
Guard him, no matter what.

868
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:05,030
Who am I?

869
01:03:05,572 --> 01:03:07,199
I'm Seok Jeong-ho, alright?

870
01:03:08,492 --> 01:03:10,869
Gosh, why is it raining out of nowhere?

871
01:03:11,036 --> 01:03:12,162
What's with the weather?

872
01:03:12,245 --> 01:03:13,747
I told you to bring an umbrella.

873
01:03:13,914 --> 01:03:15,290
Hello.

874
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:18,835
Your father is

875
01:03:19,336 --> 01:03:20,754
Justice Hwang Nam-yong, correct?

876
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:22,964
Yes.

877
01:03:23,673 --> 01:03:26,259
Have I been kidnapped?

878
01:03:26,343 --> 01:03:27,511
Are you stupid?

879
01:03:28,178 --> 01:03:29,930
I saved your life!

880
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:33,225
But

881
01:03:33,683 --> 01:03:35,852
people will keep coming,
trying to kill you.

882
01:03:35,936 --> 01:03:38,522
And we can't save you on time every time.

883
01:03:39,022 --> 01:03:40,732
Who's trying to kill me?

884
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:42,400
What did I ever do wrong?

885
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:45,237
You had your father get you a job
at JB Daehan.

886
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,905
I don't deserve death for that!

887
01:03:46,988 --> 01:03:48,114
No

888
01:03:48,198 --> 01:03:50,826
that deserves death and more to those
who want your father

889
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:52,285
to become the Chief Justice.

890
01:03:52,994 --> 01:03:55,914
They need you to die
for people to become empathetic

891
01:03:55,997 --> 01:03:58,208
so your father can finally become
the Chief Justice.

892
01:04:00,293 --> 01:04:02,128
That's ridiculous.

893
01:04:02,212 --> 01:04:04,047
- Is it? Really?
- Hey.

894
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,173
You're saying

895
01:04:06,508 --> 01:04:08,051
it's not ridiculous

896
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:10,887
that you got hired
with the lowest test score?

897
01:04:10,971 --> 01:04:12,097
Stop.

898
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:14,933
Man!

899
01:04:18,103 --> 01:04:19,104
Do you want to live?

900
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,648
Yes.

901
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:25,443
Strike first, then.

902
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,613
I'm Song Na-yeon of Daejin Daily.

903
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:29,865
Did Justice Hwang

904
01:04:29,948 --> 01:04:32,868
also help you get a job at JB Daehan?

905
01:04:34,786 --> 01:04:36,955
Yes, my father said

906
01:04:37,914 --> 01:04:40,917
the written exam and the interview were
just for formality

907
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:44,379
and that I'd get the job, no matter what.

908
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:12,198
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

909
01:05:12,282 --> 01:05:15,285
The Judiciary is in a huge shock
once again.

910
01:05:15,368 --> 01:05:17,370
Justice Hwang, under the allegations

911
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:20,040
of colluding with unfair hiring practices
and taking bribes

912
01:05:20,123 --> 01:05:21,833
submitted his letter of resignation.

913
01:05:22,292 --> 01:05:23,418
The prosecution explained

914
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:26,004
Justice Hwang allegedly took bribes
from a construction company

915
01:05:26,087 --> 01:05:27,339
and used his networks

916
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:29,549
to get his son a job he didn't qualify for

917
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:32,719
and that they planned on summoning him
for questioning soon.

918
01:05:33,053 --> 01:05:35,931
Justice Hwang submitted
his letter of resignation this morning

919
01:05:36,014 --> 01:05:39,184
and left the court without a word.

920
01:05:42,562 --> 01:05:44,314
The prosecution is aware

921
01:05:44,439 --> 01:05:45,941
of Justice Hwang receiving bribes

922
01:05:46,024 --> 01:05:49,527
and his involvement
in unfair hiring practices.

923
01:05:49,611 --> 01:05:52,447
They will announce
a date for his questioning soon.

924
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,366
Chief Justice Jeon Heung-woo is

925
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:56,701
also taking responsibility by resigning

926
01:05:56,785 --> 01:06:00,246
for the damaged reputation
of the Judiciary.

927
01:06:00,538 --> 01:06:02,791
The Office of the President has made

928
01:06:02,874 --> 01:06:04,793
an official nomination of Baek Yi-seok

929
01:06:04,876 --> 01:06:06,461
as the next Chief Justice.

930
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:08,880
Power changes are happening rapidly
within the Judiciary

931
01:06:08,964 --> 01:06:11,466
and the employees within the court
are wondering

932
01:06:11,549 --> 01:06:14,135
if this will signal a reformation

933
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:15,887
of the whole system.

934
01:06:18,098 --> 01:06:21,393
I'll invite you to the room
with the best views once you retire.

935
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:23,812
Here.

936
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:43,873
Your son will have to pay
for what he's done.

937
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:45,959
But I'll let you get away

938
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:48,503
with non-custodial investigation
and probation.

939
01:06:51,631 --> 01:06:53,216
But of course

940
01:06:54,884 --> 01:06:57,220
you'd better not let Suojae hear
about our deal.

941
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:23,038
What a pathetic man.

942
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:26,499
He got bitten in the ass by his own son.

943
01:07:31,629 --> 01:07:33,256
Here we are.

944
01:07:45,351 --> 01:07:46,853
Don't trust anyone here.

945
01:07:47,771 --> 01:07:49,981
And don't speak
unless you're asked a question.

946
01:07:50,523 --> 01:07:52,859
Don't be surprised
by anything you see or hear.

947
01:07:55,653 --> 01:07:56,696
You'll look stupid.

948
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:58,782
Yes, sir.

949
01:08:07,499 --> 01:08:09,084
Is today

950
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:12,212
the day we fill our treasure chest?

951
01:08:13,004 --> 01:08:14,506
Yes, sir.

952
01:08:15,256 --> 01:08:16,382
Mr. Han

953
01:08:18,218 --> 01:08:21,387
you know why I'm still going so strong
to this day?

954
01:08:21,846 --> 01:08:23,223
I don't know, sir.

955
01:08:23,598 --> 01:08:25,266
Because the world is the same.

956
01:08:26,518 --> 01:08:29,938
It never changes, does it?

957
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:44,702
Introduce yourself.

958
01:08:46,913 --> 01:08:49,082
I'm Judge Lee Han-young
at the Seoul Central Court.

959
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:53,545
I'm here
to serve the nation and our people.

960
01:09:08,351 --> 01:09:09,394
Take a seat.

961
01:09:41,134 --> 01:09:42,719
This is a special activity fund
from the National Intelligence Service.

962
01:09:57,901 --> 01:09:59,527
This is from the prosecution.

963
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:13,958
This is
from the Ministry of National Defense.

964
01:10:24,385 --> 01:10:26,179
This is from the National Police Agency.

965
01:10:38,483 --> 01:10:39,609
Alright, then.

966
01:10:40,568 --> 01:10:41,945
Let's serve our nation.

967
01:11:08,763 --> 01:11:10,139
These crazy bastards!

968
01:11:13,309 --> 01:11:17,313
THE JUDGE RETURNS

969
01:11:41,462 --> 01:11:42,880
The elimination has begun.

970
01:11:42,964 --> 01:11:44,090
They have a record
of everywhere we've been

971
01:11:44,173 --> 01:11:45,508
and our call history!

972
01:11:45,591 --> 01:11:47,218
Sin-jin is going to catch on soon.

973
01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:49,304
I'll get rid of Gwang-to,
who relies on mere shamans

974
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:51,014
and become the leader of Suojae.

975
01:11:51,097 --> 01:11:52,557
So, who is that?

976
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,850
Judge Lee Han-young.

977
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:55,601
And Sin-jin is behind it?

978
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,521
The prosecution will indict him
while in custody

979
01:11:58,604 --> 01:12:01,607
and Judge Lee, whom we met at the Suojae,
will be on the case.

980
01:12:01,941 --> 01:12:03,776
Hey, Byeon. Let's save a life.

981
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,153
Sin-jin and Gwang-to.

982
01:12:05,236 --> 01:12:06,529
I must stop both of them

983
01:12:06,612 --> 01:12:09,032
or the country's justice will be gone
for good.

984
