who wished to become human,

56

How did you know?

75
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,668
Your scent.

76
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,837
I smell the earth on you.

77
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,132
The scent of Myohyangsan Mountain's soil
that I've known for centuries.

Have you been well?

I was just bored without you around.

By the way, don't worry about Chun-sim.

I bet she's dozing off in the kitchen.

All right.

It's your long-awaited wedding day.

It still doesn't feel real

that I've become human
and will be wed to my beloved.

She finally became human
and married the one she loved.

And so, they lived happily ever after.

These hairpins must be new.

What's got you staring like that?

Well, look at you.

[tutting]

00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,975
So that's why
you wanted to come to the market.

116
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,852
You had an ulterior motive.

117
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,396
It's not like that.

118
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,898
If you're done looking, let's go.

My lady!

120

[mysterious music continues]

132
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,282
[soldier] That way!

133
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,953
[Eun-ho] …that human life
is endlessly fragile,

134
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,039
and their happiness
shatters far too easily.

135
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,545
That life is hard,
and death is always near.

136
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,883
That was the future that awaited.

137
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,973
So in the end,
Geum-ho would not find happiness.

[thunder rumbles]

[Eun-ho] All because she loved a human

[sirens wailing in distance]

142
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,529
[Eun-ho] And so, I became who I am today.

143
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,615
A nine-tailed fox
who refuses to love humans

144
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,450
and does not seek to become one.

145
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,077
That's who I am.

[ethereal voice vocalizing]

148
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,044
[Eun-ho] Why should I want
to become a human?

149
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,423
So trivial, powerless, aging, sickly,

150
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,925
and in the end, doomed to die.

151
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,139
Here and now,

152
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,559
one life ends…

He's good, isn't he?

168
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,017
That's Hyeon Woo-seok.

He just became a high school senior.

00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:25,065
[translating into Spanish]

171
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,443
[in Korean] Since he was
first selected for the U-13 national team,

172
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,237
he has been the starting striker
across all youth squads.

173
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,784
[Yeon-su translating into Spanish]

174
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,286
- Hey, Woo-seok! Pass!
- [Yeon-su continues translating]

175
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,748
- [player 1] Pass!
- [player 2] Cover this side!

176
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,042
Hey! You crazy idiot!

177
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,418
Woo-seok was open!

178
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,921
Stop messing around
and just pass the ball!

179
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,047
[speaks Spanish]

180
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,341
He's asking who that player is.

181
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,759
[Yong-gil] Which one?

182
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,680
[Yeon-su] That one.
The one who was messing around earlier.

183
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,225
- [Si-yeol] That's a foul!
- That's Kang Si-yeol.

184
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,644
Gosh, that kid is just crazy.

185
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,188
He's all flash and no substance.
And he never passes.

186
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,315
He tries to do everything himself.

187
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,446
[music turns exciting]

188
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,491
Hey, Si-yeol, you brat! Just tap it in!

189
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,201
Stop showing off!

190
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,953

- [music concludes]

192
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,251
Damn, that little…

193
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,380
Woo-seok, nice assist.

194
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,132
- Assist.
- [players cheering]

195
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,466
[Yong-gil clapping]

196
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,012
You think what a coach says is a joke?

197
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,474
I told you to pass to Woo-seok
whenever you get the ball.

198
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:47,230
The new youth national team coach
came to watch Woo-seok play today.

199
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,440
The least you could do
is help your friend,

200
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,526
not get in his way.

201
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,865
How is me scoring a goal
getting in Woo-seok's way?

202
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,119
[angrily]
So why did you have to score a goal?

203
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,080
I told you to play defense today.

204
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,708
When did I tell you to score a goal?

205
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,586
You got carried away trying to stand out.

206
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,795
Straighten up.

207
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,964
[breathes heavily]

00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,174
[grunts]

209
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,053
You've never even paid
your club fees on time,

210
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,014
and you give me this attitude.

211
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,640
[grunts]

212
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,268
[Sang-cheol] Good work.

213
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,853
- [Yong-gil] Hey, boys.
- Eat up.

214
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,855
[Yong-gil] Woo-seok's father
is treating us,

215
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,899
so make sure you thank him
before digging in.

216
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,859
[Sang-cheol] Gosh, Coach.
There's really no need.

217
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,235
[laughs]

218
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,488
- Here, have some more.
- Hey, Kang Si-yeol.

219
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,656
LET'S GO, SOSIN SOCCER CLUB!

220
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,866
[Woo-seok] Dad, hold on.

221
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,284
- Sure.
- Hold this.

222
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,871
- Kang Si-yeol.
- It's fine. I don't want any.

223
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,956
[sighs, clicks tongue]

224
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,336
[Sang-cheol] Coach.

225
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,546
[coach] Yes, good to see you.

226
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,590
- [Sang-cheol] Great game today.
- Not at all.

227
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,968
Here, use this to take the boys out
for a nice dinner next time.

228
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,970
Thank you as always, Mr. Hyeon.

[coach and Sang-cheol laugh]

230
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,265
- [coach] Thank you.
- [Sang-cheol] It's nothing.

[reporter over radio]
The contractor for Bannam Zone 2,

233
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,814
Korea's biggest redevelopment project,
will be named today.

234
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,401
With three top-tier construction companies
competing for the contract,

235
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,072
experts say Geumsu Construction,
embroiled in a power abuse scandal,

236
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,867
is unlikely to win, leaving the other two
as front-runners.

237
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,036
- In other news--
- [radio beeps, shuts off]

238
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,871
Why did you turn it off?

239
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,707
I was listening to it.

240
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,585
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.
Should I turn it back on?

241
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,962
[sighs, clicks tongue]

242
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,342
The real issue isn't abuse of power.
It's subordinates getting out of line.

243
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,762
I pay you to drive,
so why aren't you focused on driving?

244
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,973
Mr. Lee, it's not that--

245
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,474
Are your ears perking up

246
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,228
because they're trashing me on the radio?

247
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,562
- No, sir.
- [tense music playing]

248
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,439
That's not it at all.

- [Yoon] It's a red light.
- [tires screeching]

258
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,144
Did you drive here yourself?

259
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,271
I ended up driving myself.

260
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,733
Mr. Lee, there's also
the board's decision to consider.

261
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,109
- Are you sure about this?
- [sighs]

262
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,070
You mean those old geezers
telling me to stay put?

263
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,781
There's no need
for you to get involved, sir.

264
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,659
It was always going to be
a difficult contract to win.

265
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,871
Now there's a risk that
you might have to take all the blame.

266
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,290
This is why you're just an employee.

267
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,958
[tense music playing]

268
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,379
- Just take off your shirt.
- Yes, sir.

269
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,923
- Should I hire a new driver?
- Sure, whatever.

270
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,718
Just give him some money
so he doesn't run his mouth.

271
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,927
Yes, sir.

00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,934

00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,853
This project is mine.

I want every son of a bitch
in the sticks to know

275
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,693
that Lee Yoon of Geumsu Group
personally won a 9.5-trillion-won project.

276
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,155
Then those old geezers won't be able
to call me a deadbeat anymore.

277
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,241
[Secretary Choi] Mr. Lee.

278
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,869
Now is a crucial time,
with the group's succession on the line.

279
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,537
If you fail to win the contract--

280
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,540
You know that saying,
"there's nothing money can't buy"?

281
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,793
I used to think
that was just an expression.

282
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,461
But I was wrong.

283
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,339
There's nothing that money can't solve.

284
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,300
Seriously, anything's possible with money.

I'm sure you're all very busy,

You must all be stressing over

Honestly, I feel a little bad.

00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,876
I have a general idea of how much
you humans love your apartments.

331
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,463
But what can I do?
I have to make money too.

332
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm sure you all understand
since we all love money.

I told you not to worry about that.

I'm exempt from the fees.

that's not how things should be.

of a full scholarship?

I don't have an appetite.

I told you,
there's nothing to worry about.

This is important to me.

473

I'm sure it is.

474
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,323
You acted like a deadbeat,

475
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,658
and now you're
on your rich father's bad side.

I think you're going to become
a repeat customer.

[clicks tongue]

491
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,988
Then, what exactly are you capable of?

492
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,951
Judging by the fact that you need money,

493
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,453
it seems you can't do whatever you want.

494
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:18,040
Shouldn't I know
what you can and can't do

All right, let me explain something.

Where am I?

507
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,277
I guess calling you a "customer"
gave you the wrong idea.

508
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,989
That if you just give me money,
you can order me to do anything

509

think of this less as making requests
and more like praying.

518
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,217
Whether or not I grant your wish
is up to me.

519
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,970
And how I choose to grant it
is also up to me.

00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,389
How much I take,
and what I take as payment,

521
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,516
is obviously up to me as well.

522
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,310
I'm the one who asks questions, not you.

523
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:24,273
Even what you're allowed to know,
and how much, is up to me.

Do you understand now?

525
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,488
I'm telling you not to get cocky.

526
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,907

But since we're on the subject,
I'll tell you one thing.

530
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,459
I have only one principle.

531
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,794
I avoid doing
even the smallest of good deeds

532
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,713
and only avoid doing major misdeeds.

533

[chuckles]

534
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,135
Looks like you didn't get it.

535
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,971
This is important,
so I'll break it down for you.

536
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,141
I don't do good deeds.
No matter how trivial.

537
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,062
I can't risk cultivating more virtue
and accidentally becoming human.

538
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,773
As for wrongdoings,
I only avoid major ones.

539
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,858
Things like…

540
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,611
killing people.

541
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,821
That's the only thing I avoid.

542
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,617
I'm trying to avoid becoming human,
not trying to diminish my spiritual power.

It's a battlefield

where they can only climb up
by dragging others down.

and such is the human condition
I have observed for hundreds of years.

All the kids these days
seem to dress like you.

There's no such thing.

You'd believe me if I used sorcery

I'll take these too.

602
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,697
Hey, I have a question.

603
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,781
What is it?

604
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,159
"Aren't nine-tailed foxes
supposed to eat human livers

605
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,246
and seduce men to drain their life force?"

606
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,123
Yes, how did you know?

607
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,583
It was obvious.

608
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,004
Do you think you're the first human
to ask me such questions?

609
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,340
Do you know how people
in the Joseon era used to speak?

610
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,843
You think they were like…

[dramatically] "Your Majesty,"

612

"How insolent"?

Do you really think that?

614
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,516
They didn't?

615
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,477
That's all just made up
by those TV people.

It's not as if they actually
lived through that era like I did.

618
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,275
So how would they know?

619
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:22,070
You make something up,
and humans just believe it.

620
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,073
Same with the tales
about nine-tailed foxes.

[Eun-ho] When humans cultivate themselves,
they're called sages,

634
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,902
while animals that do so
are called spirit beasts.

635
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,280
So why do foxes cultivating themselves
to become human get treated like monsters?

636
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:09,326
Do they think it's easy to self-cultivate
and train until we grow nine tails?

637
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,370
Nine-tailed foxes cultivate themselves?

638
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,956
Yes, just like how sages self-cultivate
and train to become immortals,

639
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,793
nine-tailed foxes have to self-cultivate
and train to become humans.

640
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,752
Think about it.

641
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,546
Why would a nine-tailed fox,
who's self-cultivating and building karma,

642
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,048
hunt human livers? If they did that,

643
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,217
they would lose
all the spiritual power they've earned.

00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,816
I've lost all desire to be human,
so I have no reason to cultivate myself.

You're not trying
to become human? [sniffs]

But you're a nine-tailed fox. How come?

651
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,738
Because I love the way I live now.

Sometimes, humans get the wrong idea.

653

They think that living forever
would be tedious and boring.

But when you actually experience it,
there's never a dull moment

655

because the human world changes so fast.

you've never actually

But how do you know things like that?

00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,137
I just do.

810
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,391
I sometimes see fragments of the future.

811
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,726
I can't see them whenever I want.

812

I don't know when, why, or what I'll see,

813

Anyway, that guy will become rich
and famous at some point.

821
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,720
So he might become one of my clients.

822
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,929
Oh, right.

823
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:54,684
You said you grant rich people's wishes
and get paid for it, didn't you?

824
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,312
Then, maybe you could grant my wish too?

825
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,939
You think I would do that?

This is exactly why I don't bother
with troublesome human relationships.

Are you really mad?

Look, it wasn't because

I'm sorry.

I guess now that I think about it,
I did feel sorry for you.

But it's not because I think
I'm better than you or anything.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

At cafés, you have to buy
one drink per person.

That's the rule
in the human world these days.

I'm sure you are.

After all,
you're the Deity of the Big Dipper.

What brings you here all of a sudden,
interrupting my hobby like this?

You call that a hobby?

881
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:02,080
Of course. There isn't anything
more human and fun than spending money.

[Pagun exhales heavily]

If you enjoy living like a human so much,

why won't you become one,
while deceiving the eyes of Heaven?

You're missing the point.

886
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,554
Who said I want to live like a human?

Squeezing into the subway to go to work

only to collapse into sleep
from exhaustion.

890

Even if you make a few bucks like that,
you don't have time to spend it.

891
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,735
That's what it means to be human.

892
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,155
A moment of sweetness,
and a lifetime of bitterness.

[Pagun sighs]

894
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:42,829

like spending money on a pay-to-win game.

You get to enjoy all the fun stuff
without any of the inconvenience.

I wonder if the big shots up there
would even understand what I'm saying.

897
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,339
Since they're just so divine and all.

898
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,925
You're still wicked and irreverent.

Oh, whatever.

on good enough terms to sit and chat.

Let's just get straight to the point,
Lord Pagun.

902
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:05,977
So?

903
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,646
You want me to become human already?

904
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,190
Are you asking why I'm still like this

905
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,693
when all the other nine-tailed foxes
have already become human,

906
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,195
lived out their lives, and died?

If that's all, I can go now, right?

909
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,830
I'm going to go home
and unbox my new stuff.

910
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,373
[Pagun] Your scale

911
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,542
is tipping.

That can't be.

915
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,306
I put an insane amount of effort
into keeping that balance aligned.

916
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:47,768
I even earn my own money
just to appease all of you up there.

917
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,854
So how could the scale be tipping?

918
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,982
There will come a time
when you must choose.

919
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,651
Whether to become human

920
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,739
or be forever annihilated.

921
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,701

Don't make me laugh.

923
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,248
They may be deities,
but how dare they threaten me?

924
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,628
Let them try.

925
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,633
Do they still think I'm the same
naive fox who believed everything

926

the ones above told me?

927
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,720
They won't get their way.

928
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:26,432
Even you guys don't really get
the so-called Law of Heaven, do you?

929
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,310
Because it's so vague and messed up.

930
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,355
Well, there's one thing
I know for certain.

931

"Heaven's net is vast and wide,
yet nothing slips through."

You may think
you're outside of Heaven's influence,

00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:23,966
[gasps]

970
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,593
What? [yells] Who was that?

971
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,012
[breathes heavily]

972
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,682
[scoffs]

973
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,770
[Woo-seok] Wow, it was like a missile.

974
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,273
Hey, I'll go find the ball.
You go on ahead.

975
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,859
- I'll come with you.
- It's fine. You go.

976
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,569
Bye.

977
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,072
[crickets chirping]

978
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,661
Man, where did it go?

979
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,624
[Eun-ho] Was it you?

980
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,293
[quirky music playing]

981
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,253
Are you the owner of this ball?

982
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,421
Yes, I am.

983
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,923
Thank you.

984
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,095
- Wait.
- No need to thank me.

985
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:11,639
[bang]

986
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,603
- Hey--
- Go. We're done here.

987
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,938
Excuse me!

988
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,902
Wait, you're that kid from earlier.

989
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:28,114
Were you kicking a ball around this late
because I told you to get some exercise?

990
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,783
You don't look it,
but you're quite obedient.

991
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,284
What is she talking about?

992
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,287
Anyway, you shouldn't go around
popping other people's balls.

993
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:37,456
Well, I couldn't pop your head, could I?

994
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,166
Since I'm a self-cultivated beast.

995
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,793
[scoffs] Unbelievable.

996
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,877
[sighs]

997
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:44,547
Hold on.

998
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,382
They don't usually pop that easily.

999
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,008
It's not some kind of balloon--

1000
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,719
That's because you are a weak human.

1001
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,179
[Si-yeol] What did you say?

1002
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,765
Wait, who do you keep calling weak?

1003
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,934
Can't you tell just by looking?

1004
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:57,935
I'm an athlete.

1005
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,020
Is that so?

1006
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,439
[Si-yeol] I may not be much now,

1007
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,608
but in a few years,
I'm going to be a really famous athlete.

1008
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:05,943
[Eun-ho sarcastically] Right.

1009
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,988
- I don't think so.
- [echoing jingle]

1010
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,948
- What?
- [woman] Famous?

1011
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,534
- [pensive music playing]
- Which one of the two?

1012
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,453
[Eun-ho] That one over there.

1013
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,289
Maybe your friend, but not you.

1014
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,540
I saw it earlier.

1015
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,250
What are you--

1016
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,669
Your friend is going to be very famous.

1017
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,338
He'll be a world-class player
and make a lot of money too.

1018
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:30,301
I'm certain. The future
never changes after I've seen it.

1019
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,094
But as for you…

1020
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,222
- Hmm…
- [twinkling chime]

1021
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,016
- [inhales deeply]
- [echoing boing]

1022
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,018
I don't see anything at all.

1023
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,354
Who are you to say that?

1024
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,190
You don't know anything about me!

1025
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,359
You'll just be a nobody.

1026
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:51,697
You might become a mediocre player
no one remembers,

1027
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,365
but any success beyond that…

1028
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,992
[tutting]

1029
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,911
It's just not in your future.

1030
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,372
So don't get your hopes up
and dream too big.

1031
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,166
That way, you won't get hurt.

1032
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,459
[gasps] This…

1033
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,628
This woman is a complete lunatic.

1034
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,838
It's cruel, I know. [sighs dramatically]

1035
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,217
But that's just how human life is.

1036
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,636
It's not like life is being
especially cruel to you.

1037
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,054
So don't take it too hard.

1038
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,806
[gasps, sighs]

1039
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,767
[tense music playing]

1040
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,437
[slurring] Man, I did it! Damn it!

1041
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:27,149
I'm Lee Yoon. Who's going to stop me?

1042

- Move! Damn it!
- [car horn honks]

1045
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,073
Whoa!

1046

[tires screech]

1053
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,179
- Did you hear that?
- I don't know.

1054
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,681
Maybe there was an accident.

1055
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,183
It has nothing to do with me.

1056

[ominous musical sting plays]

[Yoon] I have to get out of here.

[engine revs]

- [tires screeching]

00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,629
Stop! I said stop!

00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,299
Damn it. [pants]

[pants heavily]

1075
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,924
PLEASE DISPOSE OF TRASH HERE

1076
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,176
[Yoon] Damn it.

[scoffs]

1082
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,730

It'll probably be fine.

[sirens wailing]

1088
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,877
[Si-yeol] He seemed drunk.
He was stumbling when he walked.

1089
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:56,131
[Ji-seong] So you suspect
he was intoxicated.

1090
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,218
Okay, we've requested
all the security footage from the area,

1091
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,969
so we'll identify the vehicle owner soon.

[groans]

- How may I help you?
- [Bong-chang] Well, I…

1095
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,564
Yesterday, I…

1096
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:16,860
ran someone over.

1097
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,571
[dramatic musical sting plays]

[Secretary Choi] There won't be
any problems for you, sir.

[dark intriguing music playing]

1102
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,041
[Si-yeol] It's not him.

1103
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,459
It wasn't this guy.

1104
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,961
I saw him.

1105
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,212
[Ji-seong sighs]

1106
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,463
- Sir.
- Yes?

1107
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,717
[Ji-seong] Are you sure
you were the one driving?

1108
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,929
Yes. I secretly took a company car out,

1109
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,598
- and made a mistake--
- You're lying.

1110
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,268
You weren't the one
who caused the accident.

1111
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,103
[grunts] I saw everything!

1112
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,814
Why are you lying? Seriously!

1113
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,482
Let go of me!

1114
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,234
[Secretary Choi] Sir, we have a problem.

1115
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,445
Bong-chang just called.

1116
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:04,199
He said he couldn't bring himself to lie
and asked if we could just forget the deal

1117
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,660
in exchange for returning
all the money we gave him.

1118
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,246
What are you talking about?
Why the sudden change?

1119
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,456
He said there was a witness.

1120
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,416
[dark intriguing music continues]

1121
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,837
Bring that bastard here right now.

1122
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,593
- There's one more thing--
- What is it this time?

1123
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,554
[Secretary Choi]
I received a call from the police station.

1124
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:29,224
They said you also need to come in
for questioning as a witness, sir.

1125
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,313
[music turns tense]

00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,737
[sighs heavily] Damn it!

00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,032
How could you handle this so poorly?

1130
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,659
I apologize, sir.

1131
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:48,911
[scoffs, mutters]

1132
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,372
[sighs]

1133
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,417
Get out.

1134
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:57,878
[Secretary Choi] Pardon?

1135
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,171
[music concludes]

1136
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,089
I'll handle it myself from now on.

1137
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,257
Get out.

1138
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,344
[Secretary Choi] Mm-hmm.

1139
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,391
[door opens]

1140
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,268
- [Yoon] Jeez.
- [door closes]

1141
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,188
[sighs]

1142

[faint twinkling chime]

1145
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,910
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

1146
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,541
[lighter lid clicks]

1147
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:40,504
[rumbling whoosh]

[grunts]

1153
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,892
- Wow.
- [footsteps approaching]

1154
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,311
It's you again.

1155
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,063
[chuckles]

1156
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:08,031
It must be nice to be rich,
summoning me again after just one day.

1157
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,284
Maybe I didn't charge you
enough yesterday.

1158
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:11,785
[snickers]

1159
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:17,124
This time, it's a very simple job.
But it's urgent.

1160
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:18,834
What a shame.

1161
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,837
I was thinking of taking a break
for about ten years.

1162
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,884
[sighs] An annoying old geezer
has been pestering me lately.

1163
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,387
So, I'm rejecting your request.

1164
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,474
I'll pay you double
what I gave you yesterday.

1165
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,103
I guess I'll rest
after I handle this quickly.

1166
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,104
What is it?

1167
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:43,400
URI GARAM HOSPITAL

1168
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,484
[music concludes]

1169
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,411
[sighs heavily]

1170
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:07,507
[EKG monitor beeping]

1171
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,053
[Si-yeol] Who are you?

1172
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,224
You again?

1173
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,644
It seems we're deeply connected by fate.

1174
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,980
The soccer ball from yesterday, right?

1175
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,651
But how did you know I was here?

1176
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:26,735
Right.

1177
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,406
I'm here to tweak your memory a bit.

1178
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,616
What?

1179
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,452
Look straight at me. Don't look away.

1180
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,914
- [fingers snap]
- [twinkling chime]

1181
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,752
About what you saw last night…

1182
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:44,836
[inhales]

1183

[crowd cheering]

1185
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,944
[Eun-ho] Wait a minute.

1186
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,279
- [vocalizing fades]
- This can't be happening.

1187
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:15,117
[moody pop song playing]

1188

[gasps]

1189
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,661
No way.

1190
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,707
Their fates have switched?

1191
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,586
- [gasps]
- [tense musical sting plays]

1192
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,338
What is this now?

1193
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,465
[Pagun]
You're still wicked and irreverent.

1194
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:32,092
[breathes shakily]

1195
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,928
- [echoing chime]
- [Pagun] Your scale

1196
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,763
is tipping.

1197
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:44,271
[moody pop song continues]

- [song fades]
- [fox squealing]

1204
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,138
NO TAIL TO TELL

1205
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,350
[Eun-ho] I said I lost a huge chunk
of my spiritual power.

1206
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,811
- You're going to help me.
- [upbeat pop song playing]

1207
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,229
I mean, what are you exactly?

1208
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,605
[Eun-ho] This beauty. And this mystique.

1209
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,482
- A demon?
- A nine-tailed fox!

1210
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,443
But no matter how much
I think about it, I just don't get it.

1211
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,070
What did I do that was so wrong?

1212
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,781
A human has died. Because of you.

1213
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,199
[in English] Who are we?

1214
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,724
[Eun-ho in Korean] Kang Si-yeol.
How much does he really make?

1215
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:23,787
[woman] Apparently,
he makes 500 million won a week.

1216
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,831
I'm so proud that I am me.

1217
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:27,249
Long time no see, Si-yeol.

1218
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,376
- Did he seriously not recognize me?
- [fans cheering]

1219
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,669
[scoffs loudly]

1220
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:34,089
You want to catch that hit-and-run driver
and make him pay, right?

1221
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,842
I killed someone!

1222
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,427
- Jeez!
- [Eun-ho] So, tell me. Whatever it is.

1223
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:40,720
What's your wish?

1224
