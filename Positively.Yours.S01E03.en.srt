[Production guidelines were followed

3
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,333
So,

4
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,233
[Episode 3]
let's meet at least three times a week.

5
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,233
What?

6
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:50,233
Love. Let's give it a try properly.

7
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:54,333
Are you always this clingy?

8
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,433
What did you say?

9
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:59,000
I have absolutely no intention
of marrying or dating you.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,400
Not at all.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,767
So,

12
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:06,333
it seems you've misunderstood me.

13
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,833
I said I'd help you...

14
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:12,133
So I'm telling you I don't need your help.

15
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:14,700
- Not even a little?
- Not even a little.

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,567
Then what about that night?

17
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:20,733
Let's just say we both had fun.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,200
Let's be cool about it.

19
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:38,833
Keep your voice down. People are staring.

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,167
Unbelievable.

21
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,267
This is ridiculous.

22
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:44,500
She doesn't need any help?

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,533
'Be cool about it'?

24
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:48,633
I'll handle it, so just rest.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,467
Is she giving up everything
and just going to Germany like this?

26
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,267
Seriously...

27
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:11,033
I even turned a blind eye to her
being with another man.

28
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:13,267
You know what? Fine.
This is for the best anyway.

29
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,433
Let's just go our separate ways.

30
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:20,000
What? Where'd he go?

31
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,267
Secretary Go.

32
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,667
Sec... huh?

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,633
Where'd he go?

34
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,900
He actually said that? The father?

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,133
I told you.

36
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,967
He's from a completely different world.

37
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,367
I have to face him at work every day.

38
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,567
He's the president. And I'm just an employee.

39
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:43,600
Would someone like him suddenly
claim the baby is his? Does that make sense?

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,367
Ugh, your stubbornness is unreal.

41
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,567
Would a guy propose marriage

42
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,567
to a woman he doesn't even care about?

43
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you think he said that
because he likes me?

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,167
Oh my, then why?

45
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,500
Responsibility.

46
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
It's obviously out of responsibility.

47
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,267
I never planned on marrying anyway,
leaving that option only raises expectations.

48
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,167
Ms. Hui Won.

49
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:08,033
Hold on, I'll call you back later.

50
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:10,933
What brings you here?

51
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,033
I was just passing by.

52
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,100
Have you eaten?

53
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:32,000
Here are the resume and documents
of Jang Hui Won that you requested.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,100
[Manager Jang Hui Won]
This baby wasn't planned.

55
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,900
At the most crucial moment,

56
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,833
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
has arrived alongside this new life.

57
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,633
Are you after the money?

58
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:46,567
Or are you trying to trap a man
to climb the social ladder?

59
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:48,367
I'll pay today.

60
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,900
Order anything you want.

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,733
I asked you out, so I'll pay.

62
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,467
No, you treated me to meat last time.

63
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:59,233
Actually, I got paid today.

64
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:14,100
Have you made your choice?

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,067
I guess my own life is
still more important to me.

66
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,933
Life has taught me

67
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:27,033
that a child who could be a blessing to some

68
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,200
can become a burden to others.

69
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,433
You can have a child again
when you are ready.

70
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:34,167
Again?

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,067
What does the father say?
He's not against it?

72
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,233
He doesn't know yet.

73
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:46,200
It's my decision alone.

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,467
Dragging it out only harms the woman's body.

75
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:53,433
What can men even do?
They can't carry the baby for us.

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,967
The food's getting cold.

77
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,540
[Mom]

78
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,467
She came alone and seemed a bit drunk.

79
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,833
Get up, I'll take you home.

81
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,733
I can go alone.

82
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,533
Stop being so stubborn.

83
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,533
How bad must it be if you called me?

84
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,867
I've managed just fine on my own.

85
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,633
What are you saying?

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,667
Goodbye.

87
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,316
I'll pay for this...

88
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,567
Thank you for your hard work.

89
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,500
Mom!

90
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,367
Why do you keep saying
you'll do everything alone?

91
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,500
What's wrong with you?

92
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,867
You acting like this makes me uncomfortable.

93
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:16,367
Am I a stranger to you?

94
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,333
If you don't rely on me,
who will you rely on?

95
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,567
That's your problem, Mom.

96
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,033
You never let anyone close,

97
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,767
and it just drives everyone around you crazy.

98
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,500
So,

99
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,900
that's why your dad cheated?

100
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,067
Is that it?

101
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,300
Why are you twisting my words?

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,067
You mean that, right?

103
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,233
You're blaming me now, aren't you?

104
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:41,200
Basically, you're saying
it's all my own fault!

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,433
Yeah.

106
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,567
I never even asked for your devotion.

107
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:48,200
All I wanted was a little praise or a smile.

108
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,433
How can you only think
about yourself until the very end?

109
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:51,933
If I were you,

110
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,333
I would never live like you, understand?

111
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,300
You should've been on my side.

112
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,767
Even if everyone else turns their backs,

113
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,500
you should have been with me!

114
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:18,233
You bad girl.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,667
Hui Won, drink this.

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
She's so selfish.

117
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,267
She can't possibly be that indifferent.

118
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,500
She was like that earlier too.

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,133
She doesn't care at all
that her daughter is pregnant.

120
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,233
But what annoys me more is

121
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,900
that I might become like Mom.

122
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,567
I might end up regretting
things just like she said.

123
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:26,800
You...

124
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Hey, you blockhead!

125
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,067
Why are you worrying about that?

126
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,500
Just because you made the same decision
doesn't mean it'll be the same.

127
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,633
You're not your mom.

128
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,867
Even if you have a baby,
you can live well. So why not?

129
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:39,367
Just do what you want.

130
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:42,300
If someone throws stones,
I'll take the blow for you.

131
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,067
If you're having the baby,
I'll help raise it.

132
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:51,167
So go on the path you truly want. Okay?

133
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,833
Okay.

134
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,700
Thank you.

135
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,133
What will you do now?

136
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,333
You're not actually going
to keep it, are you?

137
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,167
Are you even thinking
about marrying that guy?

138
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,033
No, it's not like that.

139
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,533
Hey, aren't you going home?

140
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,000
Staying here?

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,067
Anyway, I'm your secretary.

142
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:41,100
My boss is pulling that stony face now.
How could I even go home?

143
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,200
What is it?

144
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,133
What's the problem? Tell me.

145
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,733
Have you ever fought with your mom?

146
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:53,167
If anyone in Korea hasn't fought
with their mom, tell them to step forward.

147
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,133
If there's anyone, I'll applaud them all day.

148
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,633
I got scolded a lot by Mom.

149
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,033
Got punished for talking back,
even beaten with a stick.

150
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,467
Kicked out in freezing winter
wearing just long johns.

151
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,167
No, not that.

152
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,133
I mean fights where you hurt each other.

153
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,233
Don't tell me you fought with your mother?

154
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:11,200
No, it's not that. I'm just curious.

155
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,633
Fought and hurt each other?

156
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,667
- I have.
- How was it?

157
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:20,567
It hurt, both me and Mom.

158
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:24,867
We dug at each other
with sharp words, of course it hurt.

159
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:28,000
But you know those wounds can heal, right?

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,367
Clean the wound,
put a bandage, wait a few days,

161
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,700
and new skin grows back.

162
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,267
So,

163
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:40,100
that's why what comes after
the wound is important.

164
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,633
What if new skin doesn't grow in days?

165
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:46,800
Then you wait patiently until it heals.

166
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,600
If you fought with your mom, make up fast.

167
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,067
How old are you now,
still fighting with your mom?

168
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,333
That's not what I...

169
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:59,400
Anyway, thanks.

170
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,100
Thanks... what? I didn't catch that.

171
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,800
Thanks... what?

172
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,833
Secretary Go, go home now.

173
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,767
You're driving me crazy.

174
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,876
Turn off all the lights when you leave.

175

A thirsty person digs a well.

182
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:34,800
Though I confess and get rejected,
we can't be friends?

No.

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,633
It's not that I didn't try to contact you...

Oh, whatever.

186
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,167
We've kissed. What kind of friends is that?

187
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,467
I want to stay

188
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:49,100
as someone who can
cross the line with you anytime.

189
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,367
This is making me uncomfortable.

190
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,567
Do you have a girlfriend?

191
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,167
- Or someone you like?
- Huh?

192
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,100
Tell me if you find someone.

193
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,567
So I can try harder.

194
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,767
Hey, Hwang Mi Ran.

195
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:58,767
This is frustrating.

196
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,033
Why hold back your feelings?

197
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,467
If you overthink, you'll miss good people.

198
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,333
Gonna miss me?

199
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:15,167
Tell the president to come out!

200
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:19,367
You gave alcohol to a breastfeeding woman?
Are you insane?

201
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:20,867
What are you doing?

202
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:24,433
Call the president here. Get him now!

203
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,633
- Let go!
- You can't do this here.

204
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:27,833
- Let me go!
- Come out!

205
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,567
I won't just stay still.

206
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,467

demanding the president come out.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,540
I heard he ramped up beer shipments

209
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,900
and gave them away for free
at postpartum care centers.

210
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,000
Doesn't that smell fishy?

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,033
See?

212
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:42,167
Then and now, he does whatever he wants.

213
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:46,567
Kang Du Jun, always stirring up trouble,
becomes the president of Taehan Liquor?

214
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,000
It's the Chairman's order.

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,100
We'll just have to wait and see.

216
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,967
Whether he arbitrarily increased shipments
or gave things away for free,

217
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,500
none of that matters.

218
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,367
What matters is giving the woman alcohol.
We just need to frame it.

Plenty of bait, right?

based on the articles anyway.

I was already looking for the right timing.

225
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,667
There's no such thing as the 'right timing.'

226
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,100
You make your own timing.

227

You're good at that, Uncle.

will go to Se Hyeon next.

Well,

my life feels too precious

236
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,667
to be satisfied with just that.

237
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,667
I never even asked for your devotion.

238
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,233
All I wanted was a little praise or a smile.

239
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:14,967
How can you only think
about yourself until the very end?

240
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,467
If I were you,

241
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:19,867
I would never live like you, understand?

242
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,033
I told you to cut back on the foundation work
and unprofitable ventures.

243
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,267
And what's with the postpartum care center?

244
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:33,033
And the shelter for single mothers?

245
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:37,500
It sounds like you think I'm so powerless
to handle even charitable and volunteer work.

246
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,033
Charity itself isn't the issue,

247
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:40,800
but depending on the organization,

248
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,033
it could easily become scandal fodder.

249
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:48,367
I've heard Moo Young's been
doing rounds with journalists lately.

Don't worry.

I won't just take it
lying down like last time.

Why do you ask?

After what happened to your brother,

256
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:05,033
I wondered if she still holds a grudge.

Ah, enough about that.

What? Mr. Lee? Has that punk lost his mind?

Tell him to get out.

Show him what happens
when he stabs me in the back.

If my second daughter-in-law is like her,
I won't live out my days peacefully.

What, you have something to say?

Vice Chairman Kang Moo Young

278
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,967
is famously two-faced.

279
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,767
I was wondering if working with him is okay.

280
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,667
Have you ever grown plants?

281
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,667
Pardon?

282
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,433
You know about pruning
when growing plants, right?

283
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:32,700
Ah, yes.

284
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,667
You don't just cut off the dead branches.
You also cut healthy ones.

285
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,567
Why do you think that is?

286
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:41,167
Because they steal too many nutrients?

287
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,000
At first, they're needed
to grow together vigorously,

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,988
but no matter how strong,
if they steal too many nutrients,

289
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,067
they just become obstacles.

290
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:53,500
That's when you prune them.

291
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,367
I've already calculated
the timing for the cuts.

the bitterness as much as possible.

Yes, understood.

295

And for the marketing plan,

296
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:17,367
let's also target new channels
like trendy bars or emotional pubs.

from before planning
the new product up to its launch.

311
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,900
So is there any chance the idea was leaked?

312

That's absurd, sir.

Actually, it's not entirely impossible.

314

They released it way earlier than we did.

315
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,000
There's no way they plagiarized us.

Who's in charge of this?

Come to think of it, the manager for this
is the one chosen for Germany, right?

Is it Manager Jang Hui Won?

321

Before the Germany results were announced,

322
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:27,933
if launching this new product
was counted as bonus points,

323
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:31,667
wouldn't that make the plagiarism claim
highly plausible?

Even if I copied it, I'd surely
get caught, so why would I do it?

329
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,533
- Why would I?
- Bonus points.

330
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:54,367
- Bonus points?
- Really?

331
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,433
- No...
- No way.

332
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,133
You wanted to study in Germany, right?

333
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:00,666
Didn't you plagiarize for bonus points?

334
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,667
Team Leader.

335
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,667
Rumors are spreading that
the scores from this new product

336
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,900
are included in your
Germany study application.

337
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,033
Did you think you could just
wrap it up and dash off to Germany?

338
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:11,233
Well, Team Leader.

339
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,367
You're being too harsh.

340
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,367
True, no matter how much she wanted Germany,

341
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,900
I doubt the manager would go that far.

342
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,967
Why not?

343
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,100
Hearing it now, I think it's possible.

344
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,500
Why are you siding against her too,
Assistant Manager?

345
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,733
Think carefully, all of you.

346
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,233
Because of her, our whole team
is about to take the fall.

347
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:28,300
Because of you, our whole team
is going to be investigated, okay?

348
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,367
Ah, I shouldn't have asked.

349
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,233
She's not getting punished
on my account, right?

350
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:52,167
- Jeez.
- Oh, my.

351
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,567
- You scared me!
- You startled me.

352
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,833
What is it?

353
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,900
Where are you heading?

354
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,700
No, nowhere.

355
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,567
Then what brings you here, Ms. Jang Hui Won?

356
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,267
I came to see you, President.

357
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,800
Then come on in.

358
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:14,204
Sit.

359
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:18,067
Do you need any help from me?

360
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,267
No.

361
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:22,467
I didn't copy it.

362
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,667
Are you here to explain yourself now?

363
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:30,533
Explanations won't help now.
We need to manage the situation.

364
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,800
Then,

365
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,967
I'll take responsibility.

366
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,500
Responsibility? How?

367
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,433
I'll resolve this quickly.

368
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:41,733
But please just punish me alone.

369
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:44,567
Our team did nothing wrong.

370
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,900
Ms. Jang Hui Won.

371
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,333
Who do you think you are?

372
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:54,100
Since you handle everything alone,
you can clean up this mess alone too?

373
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,567
- That's not what I...
- Since we're short on time,

374
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:58,100
report to me in real-time as soon as
the new concept comes out.

375
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,500
Bring it over as soon as it's ready.

376
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,533
In person?

377
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:04,667
Why? Don't trust yourself?

378
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:09,300
Yes, I'll do it.

379
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,000
What on earth is happening?

380
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,900
Exactly. Everyone knows
Manager Jang is competent.

381
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,933
Only Manager Jang knows the truth.

382
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:39,933
Still, plagiarism is out of the question.

383
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:42,167
You've all seen her working alongside us.

384
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,300
Anyway, let's wait here
awhile before going in.

385

Sit down, sit down.

Isn't it just that you want to take a break?

387
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,800
I feel like the team leader
will scold us if she sees us.

388
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,500
It's okay. The atmosphere is
tense enough already.

389
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,533
Huh? Team Leader?

390
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,267
Where?

391
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,667
Sorry, my mistake.

392
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,733
I didn't stand up
because you said 'team leader'.

393
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:05,867
- Me neither.
- A colleague

394
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:06,900
is in trouble.

395
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,333
I can't just sit here comfortably!

- Go!

397

- Let's go.
- Okay.

398

Are you done already?

399
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:19,267
This is a recipe our team
succeeded with in another project,

400
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:22,000
and it should work well with this ale beer.

401
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,167
- Not impressive.
- Pardon?

402

Try again.

403
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,267
I have something urgent to attend to.

404
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,633
President, wait a moment.

Well...

I'm sorry for trying to grab you

- all of a sudden...
- Focus on doing it right, not fast.

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,600
But why the serious face over this?

410
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,833
Wow, the food at the cafeteria was excellent.

411
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,367
The balance of carbs, protein,
and fat was absolutely perfect.

Can you even eat in this situation?
I haven't even eaten yet.

413
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:42,567
Actually, the more critical the situation,
the more you need to eat properly.

414
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:46,667
By the way, Manager Jang must be
busy fixing this. I wonder if she's eaten.

415
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,800
Should I get her something to eat?

416
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,733
Why are you worrying about Manager Jang?

417
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:51,733
Am I not allowed to worry?

418

She's struggling
to handle it alone right now...

419
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
You should worry about me like that.

- Wow.

You are not even a child.

Little Kang Du Jun, so what
should I prepare for lunch?

423
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,833
Like sausages with ketchup in a heart shape?

Pay attention to the wrap too.
Make it special.

Don't do it half-heartedly.

431

I'll put a heart on the wrapping paper
for you, little Kang Du Jun.

- Don't overdo it.
- Yes.

What proof do they have that you copied it?

434

Why are you taking all the blame?

435
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,700
It's too identical to be a coincidence.

436

And it's not a small amount of money.

437

So I just said I'd handle it.

You said that recipe didn't exist
when you first developed it.

That's right.

for a favor like this besides you?

[Project Document]
Until now,

561
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:17,067
we've relied solely on
imported aroma hops for brewing our beer.

562
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:18,127
If you look here,

563

there's a domestic hop producer...

Let's call it a day.

It feels like you're just skimming
the surface in the same way.

566
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:28,600
Why? What on earth is the reason?

what's wrong and how.

The reason...

00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:36,700
Then shall we start
with the first concept you proposed?

570
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,100
Do you know why Taehan Liquor
abandoned ale production ten years ago?

571
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,733
Because sales didn't meet expectations.

572
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:48,100
Yes, exactly. We failed to achieve
the expected results.

573
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,100
So we boldly cut our losses
and decided to invest in what we do better.

574
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,900
But now, after ten years,

575
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,967
when we're barely meeting expectations
with a fresh concept for this ale challenge,

576
00:33:56,967 --> 00:34:00,167
do you really think recycling a recipe
used elsewhere will work?

577
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,733
- That's...
- The second concept.

Despite ale's strengths,
emphasizing lager's refreshment

So you're saying there were
reasons behind everything.

582
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:17,033
From the start, Manager Jang,
your approach was wrong.

583
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:18,667
Just because you're the manager in charge,

584
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,967
you think you alone can solve
this huge project's problems?

585
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:24,800
Don't you think that approach is reckless
and irresponsible from the get-go?

586
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,633
Since it's come up,

587
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:30,000
why sacrifice your health
and stake your life on results?

You've already received ample incentives,

I don't know. Honestly, I just don't get it.

623
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:26,067
I mean, even so, making a pregnant woman
go through that is harsh.

624
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:30,467
But his reasons were all valid though.

625
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:34,100
Can't the manager solve
some things on their own?

626
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,367
I just don't want to inconvenience
the team since it's my responsibility.

627
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:39,567
That's why I did it.

628
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:41,567
I know. I know very well.

Don't stress yourself out
over that for no reason.

What, did you come to apologize?

636
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:30,233
Or did you come to hear an apology?

637
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:34,067
After thinking about it,
it wasn't completely unreasonable.

638
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:36,867
Switching the aroma hops
to domestically grown hops.

639
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:39,667

for our current situation...

Did you come all the way
here just to say that?

No, actually, the audit team...

642
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:47,933
It's fine. You don't need to sugarcoat it.

It's true that my proposal wasn't great.

No, that's not really it...

I admit it.

646
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,567
I was desperate and only
thinking about fixing things.

647
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,867
I ignored responsibility and hierarchy,
and took it all upon myself.

But,

649
00:37:58,867 --> 00:37:59,933
the choices I made

650
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:02,400
might seem irresponsible to you, President,

651
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,067
but they were choices
made for specific reasons.

652
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:06,700
They weren't decisions I made lightly at all.

653
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,667
So...

654
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,400
I mean...

655
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:14,236
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

656
00:38:14,236 --> 00:38:15,700
It's...

657
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
- My belly...
- Belly?

658
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,133
- What's wrong with it? Huh?
- Ow!

659
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,633
The baby...

660
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,167
Nothing's wrong with the baby, right?

661
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,300
That shouldn't be the case,
so relax and get examined.

662
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,133
I'll handle things here, so don't worry.

663
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:33,067
Excuse me.

664
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:34,700
Guardian for Jang Hui Won?

665
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,733
Yes.

666
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,900
Please fill out this form.

667
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,833
It seems the mother has been
under a lot of stress.

668
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:53,367
The risk of miscarriage is high
in early pregnancy, so be extra careful.

669
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:55,833
Are you here to explain yourself now?

670
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,567
Explanations won't help now.

671
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:58,633
We need to manage the situation.

672
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:00,267
Just because you're the manager in charge,

673
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:02,667
you think you alone can solve
this huge project's problems?

674
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:06,467
Don't you think that approach is reckless
and irresponsible from the get-go?

675
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:21,532
[Min Uk]

676
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,700
Yeah, what happened? Did everything go well?

677
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,400
Hello?

678
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:36,467
Isn't this Jang Hui Won's phone?

679
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:39,367
- Who are you?
- And who are you?

680
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:42,100
- Are you that male friend?
- Do you know me?

681
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,233
I'm the person responsible for Jang Hui Won.

682
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,660
Ah, yes.

683
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,967
Since Hui Won's next to you,
can I talk to her?

684
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:51,833
- It's work.
- Hui Won is sleeping right now.

685
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,333
It's barely 8 PM.

686
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:56,533
Isn't it rude to call a friend
with a boyfriend at 8 o'clock at night?

687
00:39:56,533 --> 00:40:00,367
No matter how tired she is,
she doesn't sleep at 8 PM.

688
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,833
Why are you interfering
with her sleeping schedule?

689
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,067
What?

690
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:05,433
No, what I meant was...

691
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:08,767
From now on, please refrain
from calling Ms. Jang Hui Won

692
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:09,867
for personal matters after 7 PM.

693
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,933
And if you have business,
text instead of calling.

694
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:13,033
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up.

695
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:15,800
- That's not it, hello?
- What are you doing there?

696
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
You're awake.

697
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,167
How are you feeling?

698
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,900
How's the baby?

699
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,900
Ah, well...

700
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:36,367
As you can see, it's now
about the size of a gummy bear.

701
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,133
This is the yolk sac.

702
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,800
And over here is the head.

703
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,100
- See it?
- Yes.

704
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,933
Shall we listen to the heartbeat?

705
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:52,333
The ultrasound shows it's healthy,

706
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,867
but because of the stomach cramps
and spotting this time,

707
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:57,000
I'll give you a shot to prevent miscarriage.

708
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,433
Please get absolute rest
for the next few days.

709
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:02,133
Okay.

710
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:58,233
I'm sure I've heard that voice somewhere.

711
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:03,233
Cha Min Uk? What brings you here?
Coming all this way to find me?

712
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:04,433
I have something to ask you.

713
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:05,700
Tsk, what is it?

714
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,667
The baby's father, how did he look
at the OB-GYN?

715
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,600
Do you happen to know what he does?

716
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,500
- One tteokbokki here, please.
- Rolled omelet.

717
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,767
One rolled omelet too, please.

718
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:15,367
Got it. I'll make it delicious.

719
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,433
- Yes.
- Yes.

720
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:19,167
Hold on.

721
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,604
You absolutely cannot tell Min Uk

722
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:28,533
that the father is the president
of our company, got it?

723
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:30,000
I know, but...

724
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,467
Won't he feel worse if he finds out later?

725
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,800
Don't you remember?

726
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,100
Back in college,

727
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,367
Min Ji and Jae Hyun got caught

728
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:39,133
dating in the club room.

729
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:40,900
They begged the three of us
to keep it secret.

730
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,800
But Cha Min Uk couldn't control
his expression and was fidgeting.

731
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,167
Then the whole school found out in a week.

732
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:47,367
Not a week, three days.

733
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:48,367
Right, right!

734
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:50,233
That legendary incident.

735
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:52,900
He's completely transparent.
You can read everything on his face.

736
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,000
Okay, got it. I'll keep it secret.

737
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Promise.

738
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,867
- Promise.
- Wow, unbelievable!

739
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,067
Why? What is it?

740
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,933
Jae Hyun and Min Ji are getting married.

741
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,867
Did you guys know? They got back together?

742
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:06,867
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

743
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:10,033
And they're getting married just
three months after getting back together?

744
00:43:12,267 --> 00:43:13,800
Yeah.

745
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,133
Yeah.

746
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,167
How come I didn't know?

747
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:17,833
Why didn't anyone tell me?

748
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,833
- I'm good at keeping secrets.
- Yeah.

749
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,533
I know.

750
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:26,767
Well, I called Hui Won,

751
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:27,800
and that guy just answered,

752
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,633
said his piece, and hung up.

753
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:30,633
Was it the same that day?

754
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:32,900
Rude and inconsiderate?

755
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,800
Well, I only saw him briefly,
so I don't clearly remember...

756
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,967
Ugh, seriously, where did she
even meet a guy like that?

757
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:42,267
By the way, you came all the way here
just to ask that?

758
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:45,567
Do you like Hui Won or something?

759
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:47,167
- Me?
- I mean,

760
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:50,233
it's unlike you to suddenly
come over and interrogate me,

761
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:52,567
and that you care whether he's a good guy.

762
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:54,300
Hey, you!

763
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,867
I've known her for ages.

764
00:43:57,867 --> 00:44:03,533
You know how she is. Is there anything
she does properly besides work?

765
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:05,733
Well, that's true.

766
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:10,200
But you came all the way here to ask that?

767
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,933
I could have gone for the check-up alone.

768
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:23,600
Hold on.

769
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,333
Yes?

770
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,667
What?

771
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:43,633
Sorry, but is that...

772
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:45,200
Huh?

773
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,764
No, I thought you were pregnant.

774
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:50,067
Ah.

775
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:52,188
This is non-alcoholic.

776
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:53,700
Oh.

777
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,233
I actually get scolded by the elders here
a lot because of this.

778
00:44:57,233 --> 00:45:00,500
No matter how much I explain
it's just a drink, non-alcoholic, no less,

779
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,933
the elders only believe
what they see and know.

780
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:07,367
Right, it's understandable
they'd misunderstand.

781
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:10,400
I try not to drink it much at the hospital.

782
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,333
But lately, without even this,
I'd have no joy at all.

783
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,633
My husband shows up dead drunk every night,

784
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,700
whether I'm in the hospital or not.

785
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,700
There are so many days I just
want to get completely drunk myself.

786
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:28,233
A friend who got into the postpartum
care center before me snuck this in.

787
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:30,400
Was it Taehan Liquor?

788
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,700
I heard their president has been giving

789
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,267
ten boxes of this non-alcoholic beer
to every postpartum care center lately.

790
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:36,267
The president?

791
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:41,900
Yes, he said it's a gift for mothers
who've endured so much

792
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,833
while carrying a child for ten months.

793
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:55,400
Reporter Park,

794
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,733
while you've been hushing up
the secret supplies to company sports events,

795
00:45:57,733 --> 00:46:02,400
soccer clubs, even a certain
politician's alumni association...

796
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,400
Ugh, you idiot.

797
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,572
Aren't mothers the ones
who really need a change of mood?

798
00:46:12,572 --> 00:46:15,133
Honey, I think the baby's coming.

799
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:17,667
Honey, will it take long?

800
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:19,800
Can I quickly grab a bite right here?

801
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,333
- What?
- I'll be super quick.

802
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,652
I'm just so hungry.

803
00:46:22,652 --> 00:46:24,233
Jeez.

804
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:28,633
It's not about doing it for women.
It's about helping mothers.

805
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:35,867
When the mother is at ease,
the baby will be comfortable too.

806
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,367
Mothers are humans too.

807
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,133
Thank you for today.

808
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:05,867
I've already spoken to Team Leader Bang.

809
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:08,067
Don't come to work
for a few days and rest well.

810
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:10,267
Recovering your condition is
the most important thing right now.

811
00:47:10,267 --> 00:47:13,333
What? But it's the busiest time right now...

812
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,633
I'm not just saying it.

813
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:16,733
About your idea of domestic hops,

814
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,733
we're planning to develop
a new product based on that concept.

815
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:21,033
Really?

816
00:47:21,033 --> 00:47:24,533
I've already marked a few viable items
from the ideas you submitted.

817
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:27,367
We can start developing them
once you're back.

818
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:30,233
And since we're on the topic,

819
00:47:30,233 --> 00:47:31,633
Ms. Jang Hui Won, about your dream,

820
00:47:31,633 --> 00:47:34,067
that study program in Germany
isn't your ultimate goal, is it?

821
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:35,300
That's when I made up my mind.

822
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,167
I've decided that I must
study in Germany next.

823
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:40,767
I've decided to create my own beer
that will captivate foreigners' taste buds.

824
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:41,867
That's my dream.

825
00:47:41,867 --> 00:47:46,467
Launching your own original brand.
Isn't that your ultimate goal?

826
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,333
That's right, but...

827
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:50,467
Then do you really need to go far away?

828
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,067
Why not take on the challenge right here?

829
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:56,133
That dream. I'll help make it possible.

830
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:57,867
President.

831
00:47:57,867 --> 00:48:00,367
I'll respect whatever choice you make,

832
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:03,800
but you shouldn't have regrets
about whichever path you take.

833
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,100
I'm sorry.

834
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,800
Thinking back,

835
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,900
I was only pushing my own position.

836
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:34,267
Mom!

837
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:40,067
Ugh, what now?

838
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:41,333
Mom, if you keep that up,

839
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:44,933
I'll play conservative around you,
then go all out the second I step outside.

840
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:46,652
I can't stand Gen Z.

841
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:48,348
Tsk.

842
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,067
They say the internal performance evaluation
will include individual presentations

843
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:56,033
and project participation rates.

844
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,867
Just step up saying you'd do everything,
without skipping anything.

845
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:00,367
That's exactly your problem, Mom.

846
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:02,933
It's like teaching bike riding
to a kid who just learned to walk.

847
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:05,167
You said you hate parachuting no matter what.

848
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:07,100
Then you have to stand out
through your own efforts.

849
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,267
Mom, I'm still an intern.

850
00:49:09,267 --> 00:49:12,600
And for management issues,
there's Uncle, so... whatever.

851
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,500
Taehan Liquor is yours.

852
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,467
You need to think of yourself as the owner.

853
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:20,000
It's not that I don't have ambition.
I just want to rise based on my own skills.

854
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,033
- And what if your chance never comes?
- Huh?

855
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:23,600
Your uncle has a woman, and a kid too.

856
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,267
Do you even talk to Uncle
about things like that?

857
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:28,167
What if they end up getting married?

858
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,167
Forget it.

859
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,200
Do you know how they met?

860
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,367
I don't know that much.

861
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:38,200
I wouldn't have known either if I hadn't seen
them at the OB-GYN.

862
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,233
OB-GYN?

863
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:41,833
But they seemed like strangers back then...

864
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:43,167
What are you talking about?

865
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,400
Huh?

866
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,567
Nothing, it's nothing.

867
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,433
Aren't you hungry, Mom?
Why do I suddenly feel peckish?

868
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:50,460
What do you want to have?

869
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,567
I'm feeling a bit peckish.

870
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:55,836
You caught the culprit?

871
00:49:55,836 --> 00:49:58,767
Ah, Manager Jang, you weren't
here that day, so you missed it.

872
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:00,767
It was utter chaos since the morning.

873
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:02,600
You know Team Leader Shin
from Marketing Team?

874
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,668
We are the Audit Team.

875
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,933
Yes, what's the matter?

876
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:08,233
What are you waiting for? Pack his things.

877
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:09,767
Was he not happy with this year's
salary negotiation?

878
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:12,033
Looks like he was even lining up another job.

879
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:13,513
You know Director Park from Sales

880
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:15,700
who jumped ship
to a competitor about a month ago?

881
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,800
He teamed up
with that Team Leader Baek on their side,

882
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,100
and set up the meeting in exchange

883
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,333
for selling off our new product information.

884
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:25,100
The competitor thought the idea
was solid and rushed it forward.

885
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,900
But President Kang caught onto it.

886
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,967
- How?
- During the team leader meeting,

887
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:31,367
he overheard Team Leader Shin
making a call as soon as he stepped out.

888
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:34,033
He heard something like, 'Make sure
you clean it up if the leak gets exposed.'

889
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:38,100
That sparked his suspicion,
and he got Audit Team to gather evidence.

890
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,300
Did you think you wouldn't get caught?

891
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,633
Or did you think even if caught,
you'd make a hefty profit anyway?

892
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:44,700
President Kang, that's...

893
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,733
I don't need excuses.

894
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:47,233
Just take responsibility.

895
00:50:47,233 --> 00:50:49,767
You were expecting criminal punishment
when you did this, right?

896
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:51,400
Um, President...

897
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,167
I've committed an unforgivable sin.

898
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:58,100
Team Leader Shin, you seem to be quite lucky.

899
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,067
Because I happen to have a lot of time today.

900
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:03,833
Let's go over exactly
how much damage the company took

901
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:06,200
because of the new product leak.

902
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,933
President.

903
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:10,633
Anyway, it's still not over,
but it seems to have worked out.

904
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:12,333
I see.

905
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:13,567
That's a relief.

906
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:17,133
Also, President Kang said once Manager Jang
comes back, we'd have a team dinner.

907
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:18,600
Not this, though.

908
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,767
He gave this monetary gift.

909
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:23,000
President Kang did?

910
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,667
Isn't it his way of acknowledging
how you struggled alone to save the team?

911
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,000
He acts cold, but he's
actually soft underneath.

912
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,100
- Totally.
- Just like me.

913
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:41,100
[Beer Recipe]

914
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,548
[Beer Recipe]

915
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,300
Okay.

916
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:10,268
[Study in Germany. This time,
I'm going. No matter what!]

917
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,844
[Beer Recipe]

918
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:33,933
Team Leader!

919
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:35,733
Huh?

920
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:40,467
I won't be going to Germany.

921
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:43,367
I'm giving up on the study program.

922
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:49,756
What?

923
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,467
As mentioned earlier, Team Leader Shin
will be dismissed as soon as possible.

924
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:04,767
And we'll handle the legal work properly,
with our in-house lawyer involved.

925
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:09,533
President Kang Du Jun.

926
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:12,433
I said we'd follow the procedures.

927
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:15,500
Yes, keep me updated
as the lawsuit progresses.

928
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,933
Is that all for today's schedule?

929
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:18,433
Yeah, heading straight home?

930
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:19,467
I guess so.

931
00:53:19,467 --> 00:53:20,567
Wait, no.

932
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:23,133
Come to think of it,
I set up the dinner gathering.

933
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,033
Wouldn't they feel disappointed if I skip it?

934
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:27,867
Don't tell me you're going to
the New Product Development Team's dinner?

935
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:29,300
I was thinking about it.

936
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,900
They might be eagerly waiting for me.

937
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,300
Do you know who the coolest person
at a company dinner is?

938
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,000
The president who just pays
and doesn't attend.

939
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,700
No.

940
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,333
Making an appearance
is basic presidential etiquette.

941
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,700
Let's go.

942
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,933
I said it's not etiquette!

943
00:53:43,933 --> 00:53:45,367
Nobody's waiting for you.

944
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:47,267
- Try!
- Try!

945
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,200
But why would she give up?

946
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,867
That's the mystery.

947
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:53,900
Maybe she's sick?

948
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,633
Is it because people think she got
bonus points to study abroad?

949
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:59,833
So why did you take
Team Leader Bang's side back then?

950
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,600
Oh, Manager Jang.

951
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:08,533
Assistant Manager Choi wants to treat you
to a drink to clear up the misunderstanding.

952
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:14,900
Oh, Manager Jang.

953
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,433
My apol...

954
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:19,467
You'll accept my apology, right?

955
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:26,733
No, I'd love to drink too,

956
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:30,300
but I'm on herbal medicine these days.

957
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,500
My peace offering drink.

958
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,967
See? She's not accepting it.

959
00:54:32,967 --> 00:54:34,933
No, that's not what I meant.

960
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:36,233
Oh, Assistant Manager Choi, good work today.

961
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:38,600
But we're really curious,

962
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
why did you suddenly
decide not to go to Germany?

963
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,867
Isn't this what all the fuss is about?

964
00:54:42,867 --> 00:54:46,800
I realized there's something
I need to stay and handle.

965
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,433
I can achieve my dreams here too.

966
00:54:50,433 --> 00:54:54,533
Why dig into someone who's not going?

967
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:56,300
Since we're gathered because of you,

968
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,600
down a drink to kick things off.

969
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,733
- Me?
- Why?

970
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:03,800
You're refusing a drink
from your team leader?

971
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:07,400
I'll drink it for her. Give it to me.

972
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,833
Hey, since when does an intern get so bold?

973
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:13,033
Manager Jang, my arm's getting tired.

974
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:16,133
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

975
00:55:16,133 --> 00:55:20,567
Down it! Chug, chug, chug, chug.

976
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,333
How long will you keep us waiting?

977
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:24,200
Pretend to take the glass
and accidentally spill it?

978
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,133
Or pretending to drink
and then throwing up right away?

979
00:55:26,133 --> 00:55:28,200
Ah, this is driving me crazy.

980
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,200
Does this forced-drinking culture
still exist nowadays?

981
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,132
Oh my!

982
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,967
Wow, our president is amazing.

983
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:09,500
Is the star of the night leaving already?

984
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,500
Are you drunk?

985
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,633
No.

986
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:15,567
Just pleasantly buzzed?

987
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,633
Drink with me.

988
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,667
I have to drive,

989
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,600
so it's just water.

990
00:56:52,668 --> 00:56:53,967
Oh.

991
00:56:53,967 --> 00:56:56,800
That's okay, I'll stop now.

992
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,700
Why?

993
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,900
I don't want to get drunk.

994
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,833
And I don't want to look stupid
in front of juniors.

995
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,500
Then,

996
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,133
only get drunk in front of me.

997
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:11,200
I can't do that.

998
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,267
I hate

999
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,733
how I act when I'm drunk.

1000
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:16,900
Why?

1001
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,933
People say I start acting cute

1002
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:22,767
when I'm drunk.

1003
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:24,533
You are cute.

1004
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:30,433
It's not acting, because you just are.

1005
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:44,567
You seemed to drink pretty well today.

1006
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:46,633
Why? Do I seem different to you?

1007
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:49,433
Ugh, I can't even say anything.

1008
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,800
I drank a bit because of the two of you.

1009
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,500
The two of us?

1010
00:57:55,867 --> 00:57:59,767
The baby and I are already a package deal.

1011
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,000
Why? Does that bother you?

1012
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,500
Forget it, seriously.

1013
00:58:10,633 --> 00:58:12,400
Thank you.

1014
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,600
I heard you caught the real culprit for me.

1015
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:20,167
Even when I went to the hospital before,

1016
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:23,767
I didn't say it, but I felt supported.

1017
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:27,233
When you said you'd help me achieve my dream,

1018
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:30,733
and that you'd respect any choice I make...

1019
00:58:32,867 --> 00:58:35,100
So here's the thing.

1020
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:39,233
I'm going to keep this baby.

1021
00:58:46,233 --> 00:58:49,633
This doesn't mean
I'm marrying you or anything,

1022
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:51,867
so don't misunderstand.

1023
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:56,733
Then what about taking it slow?

1024
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,633
Is that not possible either?

1025
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,500
- Pardon?
- Since you've decided to keep it,

1026
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,667
I don't want to stop here.

1027
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:13,167
There she is!

1028
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:15,233
- Get her!
- Get her!

1029
00:59:15,233 --> 00:59:17,267
- Get her.
- Get her!

1030
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:18,467
- Get her!
- Get her!

1031
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:20,233
We have to catch her!

1032
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:37,300
- Where do you think you're running to?
- Don't you leave right now.

1033
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,500
We have to go to the second round!

1034
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,533
Let's all go together!

1035
00:59:39,533 --> 00:59:40,967
Boss, come with us!

1036
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:42,700
Second round! Karaoke!

1037
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,467
Our second round is karaoke.

1038
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:47,033
Karaoke!

1039
00:59:49,867 --> 00:59:52,267
- Ah, I'll should go.
- Karaoke.

1040
00:59:52,267 --> 00:59:56,300
Karaoke!

1041
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,033
Karaoke!

1042
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:02,100
Karaoke!

1043
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,033
Karao...

1044
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,967
Why don't you tell the company
and take some rest?

1045
01:01:00,967 --> 01:01:02,733
Whether I finish it or hand it over,

1046
01:01:02,733 --> 01:01:04,467
I want to decide my own ending.

1047
01:01:04,467 --> 01:01:05,933
A field trip? Just the two of them?

1048
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:09,933
Wouldn't it hurt more if someone
you trusted betrayed you?

1049
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:12,300
Could there be some story she can't tell us?

1050
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,133
That makes sense. She's been
acting suspicious lately.

1051
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:16,167
Do you want to go to the hospital?

1052
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:17,333
I'll go with you.

1053
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,333
If anyone sees, they'll misunderstand.

1054
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:20,700
While you're thinking about this,

1055
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,800
where is he, and what is he doing?

1056
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,333
Maybe it's better not to start at all.

1057
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,933
I've never thought of it that way.

1058
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,467
Do you think I'm playing games with you?
