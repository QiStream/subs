1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
He called and explained.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,110
Hey, if you're not okay with it,
I can drop out.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,610
No, no, don't.
I shouldn't have listened to anyone else.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,530
Who told you?

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,060
Wawwa, are you okay?

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,800
I don't know. It was dark.
I couldn't see anything.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,900
Can you remember anything?

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,020
I splashed chemical fluid on their inner leg.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,420
How bad was the burn?

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,750
It shouldn't be that bad.
Probably just redness.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,350
Calm down.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,890
- Shit!
- Whoa!

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,770
Hey, what happened to you?

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,260
I spilled some chemicals at home.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,020
Sorry.

16
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,990
But when I fought back,

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,590
I splashed chemical fluid on their inner leg.

18
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,380
The inner leg?

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,740
What chemical was it?

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,220
Liquid chlorine.
I didn't screw the cap on tight.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,330
And when I put it down, it spilled.

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,980
It's on me for placing it wrong. It's fine.

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,140
- I'll go shower first.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,850
Be right back.

25
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,990
Can't sleep?

26
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,460
Yeah.

27
00:05:36,592 --> 00:05:38,472
Baikhaw.

28
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,690
What are you doing?

29
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,100
So you found out, huh?

30
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,890
Don't, Baikhaw.

31
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,780
Ow! Baikhaw, let me go.

32
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,540
Let go of me!

33
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,580
You're awake?

34
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,540
Eat.

35
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,310
You made it yourself?

36
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,370
Yeah, I did.

37
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,600
How's your leg wound?

38
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,835
It's okay.

39
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,310
Want some tea?

40
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,170
I'm good.

41
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,260
Baikhaw, you're sure, right?

42
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,370
The wound on your leg
was really from chlorine?

43
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,330
Of course, I'm sure.

44
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,670
I spilled it myself. I'd know.

45
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,800
Why?

46
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,430
You suspect me of something?

47
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,980
Can I take a look?

48
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,340
It's just... Wawwa told me...

49
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:27,952
the person who attacked her
in the dark room...

50
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,260
got splashed with chemicals.

51
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,450
The burn was probably
in the same spot as yours.

52
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,700
So you think I did it?

53
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,700
I don't know.

54
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,980
That's why I'm asking.

55
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,700
You really suspect me?

56
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,940
Will you show me or not?

57
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,260
I'm asking you for real.

58
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,700
I...

59
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,720
Why would I hurt Wawwa?

60
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,690
I don't know.

61
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,630
So you don't know,
and you're accusing me anyway?

62
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,170
If you insist you didn't do it,
then just let me see.

63
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,320
That's all you want, right?

64
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,900
Yeah.

65
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,300
And that wound you mentioned,
how bad was the burn?

66
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,330
It shouldn't be that bad.

67
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,560
Probably just redness.

68
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,680
Happy now?

69
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,770
I'm sorry.

70
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,220
Hey, if you still don't believe me,
I can show you this.

71
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,050
Here.

72
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:50,620
What is it?

73
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,910
The stuff I spilled on my leg.

74
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,430
I had to take it to the doctor.

75
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:01,030
You still don't believe me?

76
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,290
What are you doing?

77
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,850
- I'll pour it to show you.
- What are you doing?

78
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,090
I'm going to pour it on my leg to show you.

79
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,740
- You're going to pour it on yourself?
- Will you believe me then?

80
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,760
I believe you.

81
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,580
I believe you.

82
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,020
I'm sorry.

83
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,193
I'm starting to wonder
what you really think of me.

84
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:33,480
What kind of person do you think I am?

85
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,980
I'm with you every day.

86
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,180
How could you think I'd do that to Wawwa?

87
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,360
I don't know, I really don't. I'm sorry.

88
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,460
I'm sorry. I just don't know.

89
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,390
You damn well know
I've dealt with this my whole life.

90
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,650
Everyone believes what other people say.

91
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,450
No one ever asks me if it was me.

92
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,960
And I sure as hell didn't do anything.

93
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,950
I know.

94
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,470
Honestly, I thought you might be different.

95
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,290
Hey...

96
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,840
But I guess I was wrong.

97
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,480
Don't say that.

98
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,550
I said I'm sorry. I really don't know.

99
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,460
I don't know.
I don't know why I doubted you like that.

100
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,670
I'm sorry.

101
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,140
I'm sorry, okay?

102
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,170
Truly sorry.

103
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,960
Forget it. I'm used to it.

104
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,940
Hey!

105
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,905
[I'm sorry, Baikhaw,
for misunderstanding you]

106
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,136
Tao.

107
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:24,220
You scared me! What are you doing?

108
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,920
What's up?

109
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,016
You've been sitting there
with a blank face for a while.

110
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:29,848
Baikhaw and I had a fight.

111
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:32,168
Since this morning,
she still hasn't replied to my text.

112
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,560
Whoa. Was it that bad?

113
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,530
Yeah.

114
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,314
It's my fault.

115
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,208
Then I'd say keep apologizing.

116
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,440
Baikhaw should understand.

117
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,060
When it comes to you,
she's soft-hearted anyway.

118
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,264
Why do you think that?

119
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:53,808
Well, Baikhaw loves you truly.

120
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,808
She doesn't really get close to many people.

121
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,936
I mean, she really cares about you.

122
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,272
Tulip. Sit with me?

123
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,300
No, thanks.

124
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,220
Why are you avoiding me?

125
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,580
I've got class. I need to go.

126
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,870
Why didn't you reply to my text?

127
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,280
- I called you...
- If I didn't reply, isn't it obvious

128
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
that I don't want to talk?

129
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,270
I already apologized.

130
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,060
Why can't you understand?

131
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,336
I understand.

132
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:28,288
But I don't forgive you.

133
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,060
Think you're all that?

134
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,940
Hey, what the hell?

135
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,696
- Mind your own damn business.
- Jerk, she's my friend.

136
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,540
Tulip, you know what?

137
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,072
Your friend... She's so slutty.

138
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:46,376
Hey, what are you saying?

139
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,340
She's no better than me.

140
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,272
Baikhaw, she's a liar.

141
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:54,448
- You piece of shit!
- A liar?

142
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:55,890
What's your problem?

143
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,408
With a mouth like yours,
you don't need food.

144
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:59,376
Try my fist!

145
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,350
Hey!

146
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,500
Get up!

147
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,020
- Tao!
- Calm down!

148
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,048
- That's enough, Tao.
- Let me go! Let go!

149
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,824
Easy, man.

150
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,630
Sorry.

151
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,780
Because of me, you were dragged
into Q's insane rant.

152
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,488
He's rabid.

153
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:21,260
He bites anyone in sight.

154
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:29,060
About this morning... I'm sorry, too.

155
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,940
I shouldn't have thought that of you.

156
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,048
Just taking care of your mom
must be exhausting.

157
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:36,048
And you still have to deal with me.

158
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,520
Forget it.

159
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,832
Don't worry. I'm chill.

160
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,840
But when you snapped at Q,
I thought you were so cool.

161
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,260
What's with you?

162
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,590
Can I sign up to be your FC?

163
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,240
- Can I be your Stan?
- Ew, no! That's scary.

164
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,120
Oh, come on. You're just way too grossed out
by me, aren't you?

165
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,890
You're kinda weird.

166
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,520
Tao, you okay?

167
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,255
Yeah.

168
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:14,650
The teacher called me in about the fight.

169
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,138
It affects my scholarship.

170
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:17,536
I could even lose it.

171
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:18,860
Whoa!

172
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,810
That serious?

173
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,256
Yeah. But he said he'll try to sort it out,

174
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,980
and let me know how it goes.

175
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,270
How are you two now?

176
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,980
Don't worry about us. We're fine.

177
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,240
Worry about yourself.

178
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,896
If you lose the scholarship,
what will your family say?

179
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:37,280
I'm stressed as it is.

180
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:41,420
Something going on at home?

181
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,928
It's not a money problem at home.

182
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:49,752
But being a scholarship student
is a matter of pride for my family.

183
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,360
That's a lot of pressure.

184
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,410
Can I ask you something?

185
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,888
- Yeah?
- Why does Baikhaw know about your family?

186
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:08,728
I mean... I know you were at the same school,

187
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:12,528
but I didn't think you two were that close.

188
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,830
Even I don't know about your family.

189
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,300
What's this?

190
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,730
Are you sulking?

191
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,460
Do you like me or something?

192
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,070
No.

193
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,310
I'm just asking.

194
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,768
About my family,
most of my old classmates know.

195
00:16:29,768 --> 00:16:31,630
I've always been on scholarship,

196
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,030
and I'd complain about it to friends.

197
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,352
Baikhaw must've heard it.

198
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,472
Hello, Wawwa.

199
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,664
Hold on. Pause it.

200
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,730
It's all dark. I can't see anything.

201
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,536
Hey, do you have another angle?

202
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:09,648
No, that's all we've got.

203
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:12,048
Could you try checking for more,
just in case?

204
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:13,824
The other cameras are broken.

205
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,704
Only a few were recording.

206
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,660
Look, my friend was assaulted.

207
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,032
Could you please help us out?

208
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:23,180
Hey, kid.

209
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,072
Be honest. Are you drunk?

210
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:27,510
Huh? What?

211
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,320
Drunk students who come in and act weird
always use this excuse.

212
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,880
Jeez...

213
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,980
Okay, I admit I was hungover that day,

214
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,816
but I wasn't actually drunk.

215
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,152
Hungover's basically the same as drunk.

216
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:42,380
Hey, why would you say that?

217
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,192
If I'd known
I had to watch some drunk's clip,

218
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,330
I wouldn't have. It's a waste of my time.

219
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,304
Wow...

220
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,056
Alright then,
please just save the clip for us.

221
00:17:57,784 --> 00:17:59,088
Unbelievable.

222
00:17:59,088 --> 00:18:02,770
Our campus guards are assholes.

223
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,952
Let's stop watching.

224
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,128
It doesn't matter.

225
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:07,192
Nobody believes me anyway.

226
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:09,350
I believe you.

227
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,352
You'd have to be so wasted
to be that out of it.

228
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:12,740
It doesn't add up.

229
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,660
I wasn't drunk.

230
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,720
Just a little hungover.

231
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,160
Okay, and that chemical
you splashed on the attacker,

232
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,750
you're sure it wouldn't cause
a second or third-degree burn?

233
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,096
Yeah. I'm sure.

234
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:33,060
It should just be a minor burn.

235
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,140
Why are you asking?

236
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,300
Well, if the attacker's got a wound,

237
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,730
I think it'll be easier to find them.

238
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,144
Do you remember anything else, Wawwa?

239
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:48,460
When I was fighting the attacker,

240
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,280
I think I grabbed a necklace,

241
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,464
or something like that.

242
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,592
I still can't recall.

243
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:58,168
I was terrified.

244
00:18:58,168 --> 00:18:59,980
All I could think of was running for my life.

245
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,900
It's okay. Take your time.

246
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,712
Tulip. Wanna head home?

247
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:05,000
Sure.

248
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,592
See you. Keep me posted.

249
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:09,615
Bye.

250
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,334
What should we eat today?

251
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:12,816
Let go of me!

252
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,512
- Baikhaw!
- What the hell?

253
00:19:18,512 --> 00:19:20,480
- Why did you attack me?
- Do what to you?

254
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,216
A star pendant just like the attacker's.
I remember now.

255
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,176
Answer me!

256
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:28,220
Why did you do that to me?

257
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,440
Hey, Wawwa, wait, wait!

258
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,656
What's wrong with your friend?

259
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:32,980
Wawwa, calm down.

260
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,860
Don't act so innocent.

261
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,456
- Was it you? Answer me!
- Woah.

262
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:38,680
Easy, easy.

263
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,730
Wawwa, Wawwa...

264
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,632
Tulip, what I said about
grabbing off the attacker,

265
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:45,920
it was this necklace.
A star pendant just like this.

266
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,168
And the color you said you saw...

267
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,424
- What color was it?
- It was dark. I can't remember.

268
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,216
You can't remember, and you're accusing me?

269
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:54,272
It's baseless.

270
00:19:54,272 --> 00:19:55,536
It's exactly the same.
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

271
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,336
Idiot.

272
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,990
A thousand people buy ones like mine.
Open your eyes.

273
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,640
Anyone can wear this.

274
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,940
- But it's definitely this one...
- Stop talking nonsense.

275
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,010
Wawwa, calm down, and...

276
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,660
How am I supposed to calm down?

277
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,030
I was badly injured.

278
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,192
Your friend's a psycho.

279
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,152
You're the psycho
for making a baseless accusation.

280
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,280
- Baikhaw!
- What?

281
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,456
Go on! Try slapping me.

282
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:23,320
Hey, hey! Enough!

283
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,520
If you won't believe your long-time friend,

284
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,064
and you'd rather believe this bitch, fine.

285
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:30,816
Bitch.

286
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,928
Wawwa!

287
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,920
Wawwa, please listen to me.

288
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,480
Why are you following me?

289
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,520
You believe her over me anyway.

290
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,904
It's not that I don't believe you.

291
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:52,490
But what Baikhaw said is also true.

292
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,816
Anyone could have that necklace.

293
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:57,580
It could really be a coincidence.

294
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,864
And her leg wound...

295
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:03,420
At first I suspected her like you did.

296
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,090
But I saw it. It's a second-degree burn.

297
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,320
It wasn't her.

298
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,400
Or she could've poured something on it
to fake it.

299
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,992
Are you crazy?

300
00:21:13,992 --> 00:21:16,110
Why would she go that far?

301
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,112
Besides, yesterday,
she was taking care of her mom.

302
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,200
She's ill.

303
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,130
Her mom's "sick" again?

304
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,496
Don't you notice every time
something happens, her mom's sick.

305
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:35,730
Who would lie about something like that?

306
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,496
Then have you ever seen her mom?

307
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,776
Or a patient card?

308
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:42,328
Anything proving her mom's actually ill?

309
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,980
No.

310
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,248
I've never seen a patient card,

311
00:21:48,248 --> 00:21:51,010
and I've never seen anything about her mom.

312
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:57,180
Tulip, I don't know why
Baikhaw did that to me,

313
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,100
but you'd better watch out.

314
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,992
Right now,

315
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:06,030
your best friend is a venomous snake.

316
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,790
How's your mom doing?

317
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,896
Oh, my mom is about the same as usual.

318
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,696
You should take me
to visit your mom sometime.

319
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,976
We've been living together for months,

320
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:38,530
and I've never even met her.

321
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,780
It'd be good for me to know her.

322
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,368
If something happens, I can help.

323
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,070
When she's better, I'll take you to meet her.

324
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,544
Sure.

325
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,517
Wanna grab something to eat today?

326
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:27,503
I've got to go see my mom today.

327
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,104
What are you doing sitting here alone?

328
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,152
I've got an appointment later,
just killing time for now.

329
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,360
I'll get going.

330
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,728
Okay.

331
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Soi 24, please.

332
00:24:33,744 --> 00:24:35,760
Please follow that motorbike in front.

333
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,560
Come on in, I'll open it.

334
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,120
Hi, Mom.

335
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,248
- Why are you home early today?
- Finished early. Have you eaten?

336
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:10,352
I have. Go on, get inside.
Your sister's waiting inside.

337
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:11,880
Okay.

338
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,072
Tulip.

339
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,060
Tulip!

340
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,000
What are you doing here?

341
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:40,060
I'm sorry I followed you.

342
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,130
But if I hadn't come,

343
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,112
how would I know you've been lying to me
this whole time?

344
00:25:45,736 --> 00:25:48,290
What did I lie to you about?

345
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,010
You didn't lie?

346
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,824
Then what did I just see?

347
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:55,620
Your mom looks totally fine.

348
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,304
You didn't trust me, so you followed me?

349
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:03,030
I trusted you.

350
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,312
I trusted you a lot.

351
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,440
But you never told me the truth
about anything.

352
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,104
So what do you want to know?

353
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:13,520
What's actually wrong with your mom?

354
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,744
Will you tell me now?

355
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:18,904
You wouldn't understand.

356
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,080
Can we talk another day? Just go home.

357
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,736
I'm not leaving...

358
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,992
until you tell me the truth.

359
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,040
Otherwise,

360
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,744
you can pack up and get out of my apartment.

361
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,340
Mom!

362
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,848
Mom!

363
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,400
Fah, please listen to me.

364
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,540
Mom.

365
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,000
Where's the baby, honey?
Where is my baby?

366
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,552
It's okay, it's okay.

367
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:52,700
Mom.

368
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,168
Baikhaw, Baikhaw!

369
00:26:55,168 --> 00:26:56,696
It's okay, Mom. It's okay.

370
00:26:56,696 --> 00:26:59,120
The baby... She wants to eat,

371
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,160
but I can't find her. She's hungry.

372
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,360
The baby's hungry.

373
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,896
The baby... she's calling for mommy.

374
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,848
Khawfang, come to mommy.

375
00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:12,500
- You're hungry, right? Mommy's here.
- Mom.

376
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,184
Khawfang, I'm here. Come to mommy.

377
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:16,152
Mom.

378
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:18,170
Where is Khawfang?

379
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,896
Khawfang, sweetie. Mommy's here.

380
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:22,456
Mom, Mom, enough! That's enough.

381
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:24,120
- What?
- Mom, the baby isn't here. She's not here.

382
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,940
- Where is the baby?
- Mom, the baby is gone.

383
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,968
Mom, the baby died a long time ago.

384
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,560
Khawfang.

385
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,768
No, Mom, please.

386
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:41,540
Is this Khawfang?

387
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,760
I miss you, Khawfang.

388
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,584
Don't leave. Stay with mommy.

389
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:56,392
No one can take you away. Stay with mommy.

390
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,496
There, there, don't cry.

391
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,740
Toey, if anything happens,
call me right away.

392
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,014
- Sure. Don't worry.
- Thank you.

393
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:03,094
[Karoon Chanchaliewsap,
born on 22 July 1975, died on 19 August 2013]

394
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,000
Tulip.

395
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,568
I'm sorry you had to see all that.

396
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,580
I'm sorry.

397
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,016
I just suddenly followed you here.

398
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,968
It's not like my mom has something terminal.

399
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,264
But, as you saw, it's still pretty rough.

400
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,728
It's just... my mom...

401
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,192
She was pregnant with my little sister.

402
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,664
Then something happened,
and she lost the baby.

403
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,512
Fah.

404
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:27,890
Fah.

405
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:31,460
Hey, Fah! Fah!

406
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:35,504
Fah! What's wrong, Fah?

407
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,320
- Fah, what's wrong?
- Mom!

408
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,710
What's wrong, Fah?

409
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,432
Fah!

410
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:56,120
I never meant to lie to you, but...

411
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,784
This story is just so damn hard to tell.

412
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,728
It's the kind of thing that's...

413
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,304
It's really hard to talk about.

414
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:16,728
I don't even know
how people would see me if I did.

415
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,300
It's okay.

416
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,584
Screw what anyone else thinks.

417
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,240
To me, you're so strong.

418
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,416
How did you even do it?

419
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:43,888
How could you carry all of that alone
for so long?

420
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,360
From now on, if anything happens...

421
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:58,490
you've gotta tell me, okay?

422
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,584
There's nothing shameful about this.

423
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,060
I'm your friend.

424
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,736
You can tell me anything.

425
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,840
Thanks.

426
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,032
I didn't know who I could talk to.

427
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,512
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

428
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:36,420
Hey, it's okay.

429
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,288
Really, it's fine.

430
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,720
If there's anything I can do to help,
just tell me.

431
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,830
You're leaving already?

432
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,816
Khawfang.

433
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,928
Khawfang.

434
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,256
Wawwa, you're really going to do this?

435
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:07,740
Yes.

436
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,570
Where's Tulip? Why didn't she come?

437
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,620
She's probably in class.
I just called. No answer.

438
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:20,740
What if the professor doesn't believe me?

439
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,940
Don't worry. I'll come with you for support.

440
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,220
Thank you so much.

441
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,630
I'll carry it for you.

442
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,224
Thanks.

443
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,230
Tulip.

444
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,690
Tulip.

445
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,056
You forgot something.

446
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:03,860
Oh, right. Thanks.

447
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,976
Didn't get enough sleep last night?

448
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:09,410
You looked tired in class.

449
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,310
Oh, I ran out of my relaxer pills.

450
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,568
So I didn't sleep well.

451
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,435
Let's go.

452
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,720
Tulip.

453
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,208
What's going on with Baikhaw?

454
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:27,232
- Why?
- She got called in by Student Affairs.

455
00:35:27,232 --> 00:35:30,990
Apparently, she had an incident
with Wawwa from Comm Arts.

456
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,432
What?

457
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,260
Is what your classmates said true, Khemika?

458
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,104
Khemika?

459
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,090
If I speak, you won't believe me. Why bother?

460
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,144
Just tell me yes or no. That's all.

461
00:35:49,144 --> 00:35:50,408
I didn't do it.

462
00:35:50,408 --> 00:35:52,688
I went home early that day.

463
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:54,820
How could I have been there?

464
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,160
- Liar.
- Hey!

465
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,560
Stop.

466
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,380
Khemika, Wawwa has the right
to press charges.

467
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,560
This will turn into a formal investigation.

468
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,340
And it will become a much bigger matter.

469
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,290
Professor, may I stay and listen?

470
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,384
They're my friends.

471
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:23,140
Professor, please let Tulip stay.

472
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,240
Tulip is my close friend.

473
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,312
Let her see someone's true colors.

474
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,710
Professor, I really didn't do it.

475
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,152
This isn't the first time
Wawwa has slandered me.

476
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,448
She doesn't like it
that Tulip is closer to me than to her.

477
00:36:47,448 --> 00:36:48,712
What the hell are you talking about, bitch?

478
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:51,912
I'm telling the truth. You're jealous of me.

479
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,960
She goes out drinking all the time,
Professor.

480
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,560
She goes out,

481
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,500
and she always drags Tulip along.

482
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,640
Once, Wawwa got extremely drunk,

483
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,240
and left Tulip alone.

484
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,320
She almost got assaulted.

485
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,464
Luckily, I found her in time and stopped it.

486
00:37:09,464 --> 00:37:11,740
It could've been terrible.

487
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,984
Is that true, Wawwa?

488
00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:14,343
Well...

489
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,704
It did happen, but it wasn't intentional.

490
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:23,016
It was an accident. I didn't mean to.

491
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:26,480
Professor, you can ask anyone.
Everyone knows.

492
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,378
Wawwa drinks every day.

493
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,568
She comes to class hungover all the time.

494
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:33,370
The day she claims she was attacked,

495
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,910
she was hungover that day too.

496
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,880
- What the hell are you saying?
- I'm telling the truth.

497
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,680
- Truth, my ass!
- What?

498
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,992
- You're the one who attacked me.
- You're an alcoholic. Admit it.

499
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:54,735
That's alcohol.

500
00:37:57,728 --> 00:38:03,860
No, Professor. This is mine but I only
had water in it, not alcohol.

501
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,776
Are you bringing booze to campus?

502
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:08,416
Do you have a drinking problem, Wawwa?

503
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:11,820
No, I'm not that addicted.

504
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,940
You put alcohol in my bottle, didn't you?

505
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,840
- Baikhaw!
- I'll go to class now.

506
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,016
Baikhaw, tell the truth now.

507
00:38:21,016 --> 00:38:22,536
Say it yourself.

508
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:24,580
- Baikhaw!
- Stop.

509
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,008
Do you know the penalty
for bringing alcohol onto campus?

510
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:30,304
It's a serious offense.

511
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,016
But...

512
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,960
Thanks.

513
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,880
Still thinking about Wawwa?

514
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,330
Not really.

515
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,970
I just can't believe that
Wawwa could be like that.

516
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:58,816
Sometimes we think we know someone well,

517
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,544
but turns out we barely know them at all.

518
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,980
Hey.

519
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,290
Am I just giving you too much trouble?

520
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,824
With the scholarship, and your family stuff,

521
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:14,640
you've already got enough stress.

522
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,176
I don't mind, especially when it's about you.

523
00:39:18,176 --> 00:39:20,456
I'd worry for you anytime.

524
00:39:20,456 --> 00:39:22,310
What are you saying?

525
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,390
I'm not joking.

526
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:28,712
If it's about you, nothing else matters.

527
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,280
I know this probably isn't the right time

528
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
to say something like this, but still,

529
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,336
I don't want to wait anymore.

530
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,260
Tulip, will you be my girlfriend?

531
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,128
I promise,
I'll take care of you the best I can.

532
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:19,048
Hey, pick up! It's urgent!

533
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:20,900
Namo!

534
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,096
Wawwa?

535
00:40:22,096 --> 00:40:23,620
Have you seen Tulip?

536
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,336
No, why? What's wrong?

537
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:27,896
Tulip has to know this. She's in danger!

538
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:31,520
- What's going on?
- I asked one of Baikhaw's old school friends

539
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,300
about why she got canceled at her school.

540
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,488
Back then, everyone suspected Baikhaw did it.

541
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:57,824
But there wasn't enough proof,
so she got away.

542
00:40:57,824 --> 00:41:02,128
And the incident with that senior
wasn't that simple..

543
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:04,808
That senior had a boyfriend.

544
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:08,744
And rumor has it
that Baikhaw stole him from her.

545
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,120
Okay.

546
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,620
Let's give it a try.

547
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,728
Please take care of me.

548
00:41:19,648 --> 00:41:21,080
I'd be glad to.

549
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,550
We have to tell Tulip now!

550
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,430
- Okay, I'll help look for her too.
- Yeah.

551
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,096
Please help me.

552
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,072
Finally...

553
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Shit! Hello? Namo?

554
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,456
Tulip's not picking up.
Where are you, Wawwa?

555
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:01,808
I'm in the bathroom. Had to pee.

556
00:42:01,808 --> 00:42:03,736
I'm leaving now.

557
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:07,420
Hello? Wawwa? You still there?

558
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,312
Namo! Help! I'm stuck inside the bathroom!

559
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:11,528
Okay, I'm coming right now!

560
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:13,480
Hello? Don't hang up yet. Hey!

561
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,580
Shit!

562
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,304
Why hang up now?

563
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,416
Stop!

564
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,360
Somebody help!

565
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,912
Help me!

566
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,027
Going to bed now. Sweet dreams.

567
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,936
Sweet dreams, my girl.

568
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:41,934
[Going to bed now. Sweet dreams.]
[Sweet dreams, my girl.]

569
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,392
Baikhaw.

570
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,064
I'm dating Tulip now.

571
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,528
I did everything you told me to.

572
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,040
I'll carry it for you.

573
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,950
- That's alcohol.
- This is mine but...

574
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,890
I only had water in it, not alcohol.

575
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,940
It shouldn't be that bad.

576
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,064
Probably just redness.

577
00:45:28,616 --> 00:45:31,420
Now it's time you gave me my reward.

578
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,496
What happened?

579
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:35,460
Wawwa just discovered something
about Baikhaw.

580
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,568
You're living with someone
who's highly dangerous.

581
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,500
Make her fall for you completely.
Then, leave her.

582
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,768
I love you guys so much.

583
00:46:51,432 --> 00:46:54,616
Love you all.
