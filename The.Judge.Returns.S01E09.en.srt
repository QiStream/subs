1
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,950
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:36,618
JB DAEHAN CONSTRUCTION HIRING RESULTS

3
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:39,329
HWANG TAE-SEONG

4
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,290
PASS

5
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:43,584
What? He passed?

6
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:47,129
Chief Justice Jeon will resign soon.

7
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:50,591
The next nominee for the position is
Justice Hwang.

8
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:53,052
That's the father of Hwang Tae-seong here.

9
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:57,181
So, you'll stop the nominee from becoming
the Chief Justice

10
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:00,517
by exposing his son for being a nepo baby?

11
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:02,936
Justice Hwang took bribes

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,730
to frame a victim into a perpetrator

13
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:07,149
in a case 18 years ago.

14
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:10,861
Justice Hwang,
who was the judge on the case

15
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:14,364
heard only S Construction's guards out

16
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:18,619
simply under the justification
that the testimonies were consistent.

17
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:22,122
So? How did the trial end?

18
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:25,334
One year and six months of imprisonment.

19
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:26,919
A year and a half in prison.

20
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:29,254
That's unbelievable.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,008
By the way

22
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:36,303
how do you know about a case
from 18 years ago?

23
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:39,348
You were only a teenager...

24
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:40,557
I was in 12th grade.

25
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,852
The victim, who ended up in prison

26
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,271
was my father.

27
00:01:48,857 --> 00:01:49,942
Mr. Lee...

28
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:52,569
The one who bribed Justice Hwang then was

29
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,947
Jang Tae-sik from S Construction.

30
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:56,532
He's

31
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:58,742
now the CEO of S Shopping.

32
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:01,370
Mr. Hwang and Mr. Jang are

33
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:03,372
still friends now.

34
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,252
What a guy, Justice Hwang.

35
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,256
Forget becoming the Chief Justice.
He shouldn't be a judge at all.

36
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:16,635
But Mr. Lee

37
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,265
who are you, really?

38
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:22,766
Me?

39
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,892
Yeah.

40
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:26,145
Lee Han-young, the judge

41
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:27,396
at the Seoul Central Court.

42
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:30,357
EPISODE 9

43
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:38,574
What now?

44
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:39,992
Not seeing Colleen today?

45
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,952
- You're not busy?
- I am.

46
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:44,329
But I have to make time
for people who matter.

47
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:45,914
But I'm busy, too.

48
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,666
Oh, is that so?

49
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,334
Next time, then.

50
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:51,044
Wait!

51
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:55,174
You said you should always make time
for those who matter.

52
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:56,300
What was that?

53
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,634
Let's meet.

54
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:02,055
Well

55
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:04,433
it's not too bad.

56
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,810
She liked this place
in our past lives, too.

57
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,146
I've been here with a colleague.

58
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:13,233
Bring up Colleen again

59
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:14,443
and you're dead meat!

60
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:17,821
Is Haenal interested in picking
a Chief Justice?

61
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,825
You need some big achievements
to take over Haenal one day.

62
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,410
I'll help you

63
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,495
make Haenal Law Firm yours.

64
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:30,626
I can't believe your audacity.

65
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,296
I don't need your help with that.

66
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,258
But who are we choosing
as the next Chief Justice?

67
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,180
So, you're telling me

68
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:46,350
to endorse Mr. Baek Yi-seok
and make him the Chief Justice?

69
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,316
And why should I do that?

70
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,110
That's your chance

71
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:59,321
to get Mr. Baek on your side.

72
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:05,494
In our past lives

73
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:08,455
Seon-cheol made Yi-seok
an unprecedentedly big offer

74
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:11,208
to make him Haenal's legal advisor.

75
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,460
But he failed.

76
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:17,547
"Baek Yi-seok,
Haenal Law Firm's legal advisor."

77
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,175
Isn't that exactly what you want?

78
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:30,435
Chief Justice Jeon's term began
less than six months ago.

79
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:33,897
You think some online critics

80
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,607
can make the guy resign?

81
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:37,651
Chief Justice Jeon will resign

82
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,528
in less than a month.

83
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,738
That's complete nonsense.

84
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,081
How are you so sure of that?

85
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:57,671
JEON HEUNG-WOO

86
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,859
JUSTICE HWANG DEMANDS CHIEF JUSTICE JEON
TO STOP ABUSING HIS POWER

87
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:20,527
Justice Hwang isn't the hero type

88
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:23,947
to speak out so recklessly.

89
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,407
Why is he doing this?

90
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,535
Because he wants to be
the next Chief Justice.

91
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:35,917
Even becoming a Justice was a long shot
for Mr. Hwang.

92
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,002
Doesn't he realize

93
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,129
the President nominates the Chief Justice?

94
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:41,340
This is absolutely nonsense.

95
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:43,008
What if Mr. Kang Sin-jin

96
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:45,594
the Senior Presiding Judge
at Seoul Central, endorses him?

97
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:50,599
- What?
- Is it still too far-fetched?

98
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,312
Han-young

99
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:59,107
you know Mr. Kang?

100
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:00,609
Enough to get his help.

101
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:07,824
You must know very well

102
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,244
that I'd be going against Mr. Kang

103
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:14,206
if I were to support Mr. Baek
as the next Chief Justice.

104
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:20,253
I can't put Haenal on the line
for this gamble.

105
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:24,091
You won't ever need to go head-to-head
with Mr. Kang.

106
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:27,344
Because I'll get rid of Justice Hwang.

107
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:30,222
All you need to do is
get the President's nomination.

108
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:32,349
This is your only chance

109
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:34,810
to hunt for Mr. Baek,
the Titan of the Judiciary.

110
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:38,897
No way!

111
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,400
Is Dad really eyeing Mr. Baek?

112
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:43,693
How did you know? I had no idea.

113
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:47,864
Because you're on Haenal's side.

114
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,741
What?

115
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,043
We just had steak...

116
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,671
How was I supposed to eat
when you dropped that heavy topic?

117
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:03,755
But you finished it...

118
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:06,258
You asked me out first

119
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:07,968
but didn't even give me time to eat!

120
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:10,095
Isn't that a breach of duty?

121
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:12,055
- "Duty"?
- Yeah, what else?

122
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:13,682
It's not like...

123
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:17,144
It's not like we were on a date, right?

124
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:22,774
We were only having dinner,
me, as the daughter of the firm

125
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:25,026
and you, as our future son-in-law
and a judge.

126
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:38,999
This is your only chance

127
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:41,501
to hunt for Mr. Baek,
the Titan of the Judiciary.

128
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,170
Hiring the Prosecutor General

129
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:46,965
and the Chief Justice as legal advisors?

130
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:49,551
Damn, I'm getting spoiled.

131
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,477
Aren't you going home?

132
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,147
Have a seat.

133
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:12,741
How would you feel
about Mr. Baek Yi-seok joining our firm?

134
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:14,534
He wouldn't do that.

135
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,453
He rejected us, even with a massive offer.

136
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:19,164
What if we made him the Chief Justice?

137
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:22,584
Would he still say no?

138
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,253
Dad!

139
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:43,063
Hey, my Mr. Senior Secretary
for Civil Affairs! You busy?

140
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,525
It's about time we caught up, isn't it?

141
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:49,152
For sure. Let's meet.

142
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:50,862
Alright, then.

143
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,698
Let's schedule something soon.

144
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,874
This is rude.

145
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:06,169
I know it's strictly business

146
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,046
but it's still a date.

147
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:12,259
You can't expect me to chow down on this

148
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,843
with the sauce all over my face.

149
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,185
I want to go.

150
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,771
The food is amazing here.

151
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,944
And

152
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:33,655
we can't get the sauce
on your white outfit.

153
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:36,116
Can't ruin your hair, either.

154
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:39,744
What are you doing?

155
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:14,446
I can wear an apron

156
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,698
without your help.

157
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:26,166
How did you know my shoe size?

158
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,293
Why wouldn't I know it?

159
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:31,129
I was forced to be your butler
on every shopping trip.

160
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:32,922
I could tell by looking at your feet.

161
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:34,883
Not bad.

162
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:37,135
Love the style, too.

163
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:39,179
No, hold up.

164
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:42,140
How many women have you dated?

165
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:44,392
You keep playing games
like there's no tomorrow!

166
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:48,021
Are you a player?

167
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:49,898
Maybe you shouldn't say that out loud.

168
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,610
It's your fault for listening.

169
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:03,662
This is nice.

170
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,248
Everything looks prettier from a distance.

171
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,250
They all shine.

172
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,544
Everything is prettier from afar.

173
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:12,712
I know.

174
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,841
It's always beautiful from afar

175
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,386
and tragic

176
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,054
close up.

177
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:32,691
Don't become our firm's son-in-law.

178
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,736
Join us as a high-ranking judge one day.

179
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:45,245
You know my family doesn't need

180
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:47,038
a husband for me

181
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:52,043
but a slave and a puppet for the firm.

182
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:57,132
So, leave me when I let you.

183
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,386
You slapped me on our first date

184
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:03,513
and now, you can't even look at me
to end things?

185
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:26,995
Well

186
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,247
you're not my type, anyway.

187
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:41,259
But I can keep these, right?

188
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:44,846
Don't you want Haenal to yourself?

189
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:47,307
I told you I'd help you.

190
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,518
You think I believe that?

191
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,686
What about me?

192
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:57,650
Why don't you try believing in me?

193
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,824
I gave you a chance to leave, okay?

194
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,495
No, I'm giving you a chance.

195
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:12,540
In hopes you'll choose
a different life this time.

196
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:31,392
Heung-woo will step down soon.

197
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:34,771
And I'll get Nam-yong to replace him.

198
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:37,607
There's no way Nam-yong can become
the Chief Justice

199
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,026
once Tae-seong is found guilty
for unfair employment.

200
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:43,655
Why, then, did Sin-jin tell me
about Tae-seong?

201
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:48,034
Mr. Lee

202
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:49,577
I can't write this article.

203
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:51,663
What?

204
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,083
Why not?

205
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,210
Why can't you write the article?

206
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:59,921
I'm not going to write
a single word for you

207
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:02,257
until you tell me who you really are.

208
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:03,675
I told you earlier.

209
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,593
Lee Han-young, a judge at Seoul Central.

210
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,136
Chief Judge Baek!

211
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,558
- You're busted.
- Huh?

212
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,601
What judge in this world

213
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,437
busts the Justice Minister nominee
and the Chief Justice?

214
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,356
Sure, let's say you're busting Mr. Hwang

215
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,275
for your father's revenge.

216
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:21,651
But

217
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,987
why did you drag Mr. Woo down?

218
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,196
Because he's a bad guy?

219
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,031
Come on.

220
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:29,450
- You're not alone, are you?
- What?

221
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,036
The prosecution arrested
Gyo-hun's daughter.

222
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,955
A mere judge can't move the prosecution.

223
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:36,249
I'm not that stupid. There's way more.

224
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:38,293
You have

225
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:40,211
Mr. Baek on your side, don't you?

226
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,046
You're shocked. I'm definitely right.

227
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,882
My gosh, I'm right again!

228
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:46,426
The draft dodger list
wasn't a coincidence, either, was it?

229
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,928
Mr. Baek made you move to Seoul

230
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:51,055
because he had a plan all along.

231
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:52,724
Wow.

232
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,434
Queen of jumping to conclusions.

233
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:55,518
You know what?

234
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,061
I'm getting sad talking about it.

235
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,814
Why would you hide that from me?

236
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:01,608
I thought we were close.

237
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,027
Don't worry.

238
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,111
I'll zip my lips

239
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,281
and throw the key away.

240
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:10,700
I'll be a shadow for both of you.

241
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,453
HWANG TAE-SEONG, JUSTICE HWANG'S SON,
UNFAIRLY GETS HIRED BY JB CONSTRUCTION

242
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:16,289
JUSTICE HWANG, A HARSH CRITIC
OF CHIEF JUSTICE JEON

243
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:18,374
IRONICALLY LOBBIED JB CONSTRUCTION
TO HIRE HIS SON

244
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:31,888
Hey!

245
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,432
Does our website look
like your personal blog?

246
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,142
Get your posts approved first!

247
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,729
I wasn't the only one tipped off about it.

248
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:40,980
Had it not been for me

249
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:43,441
another reporter would've reported on it
in ten minutes.

250
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:44,525
What?

251
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:47,737
You want other reporters to beat me
to the story?

252
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,155
Na-yeon!

253
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:50,740
Yup!

254
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:53,409
Gotta go. Bye!

255
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:57,455
My gosh.

256
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:59,999
Nobody has time to proofread my work
at this hour.

257
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,209
Ridiculous.

258
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,419
Should I open my own news agency?

259
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,174
What's taking him so long?

260
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:09,425
Here comes Mr. Hwang!

261
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,551
Justice Hwang

262
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:13,388
did you help your son get hired
at JB Daehan?

263
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:14,931
Your son worked for ten months

264
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:17,183
but the job required
three years of experience.

265
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,768
Do you agree to the allegation?

266
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:23,272
DID JUSTICE HWANG PULL STRINGS
TO GET HIS SON A JOB?

267
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:32,073
Things already went down with Mr. Woo.

268
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:34,200
Won't you get in trouble at Suojae

269
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,703
if there's an issue
with Justice Hwang, too?

270
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,329
How do you even sleep at night?

271
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:41,749
Sorry?

272
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,793
Your worries are unnecessary.

273
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,256
Nam-yong will become
the next Chief Justice.

274
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,101
How did it go?

275
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:04,605
What?

276
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,741
Mr. Hwang Tae-seong.

277
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:15,825
Yes.

278
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:16,909
Get cozy.

279
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,328
Because it's about to get uncomfortable.

280
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,708
Did you see the news?

281
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,627
What should we do?

282
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:28,921
Sort it out.

283
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,258
Can you do that?

284
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:35,344
He's the son of the next Chief Justice.

285
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,346
I wouldn't mess up.

286
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:40,058
Okay.

287
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:42,852
I'm counting on you.

288
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,191
Weren't we over already?

289
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,444
I'd like to pay you back

290
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:52,987
for bringing me to Seoul.

291
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:56,157
There's no need for that.

292
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,577
You found the list and all, anyway.

293
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,832
Why did you bring this to me?

294
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,126
This is beyond my power.

295
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:11,005
I thought I could count on you
to guard it better.

296
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:14,842
Had it not been for you,
I couldn't have gone through with it.

297
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,762
I've started yet another thing,
and I need you to see it through.

298
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:19,680
What do you mean?

299
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:23,351
Chief Justice Jeon will step down soon.

300
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,560
What?

301
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:26,229
Please become the next Chief Justice.

302
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:29,607
Look here.

303
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,943
You can't just become the Chief Justice

304
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,153
because someone asks you

305
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:36,614
or because you want to become one.

306
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:38,157
I'm well-aware of that.

307
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,326
But if you don't step up

308
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:43,704
Justice Hwang will become
the next Chief Justice.

309
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:47,834
Any Justice is qualified

310
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:50,461
to become the Chief Justice.

311
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:52,046
But not Nam-yong.

312
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,925
The President wouldn't nominate him
with his son's scandal going on.

313
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,928
Mr. Kang will get
the President to nominate him.

314
00:19:01,597 --> 00:19:03,808
Mr. Kang plans to make Mr. Hwang

315
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:06,227
his puppet in the Chief Justice position.

316
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:10,064
Once Mr. Hwang becomes the Chief Justice

317
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:13,109
bus drivers will be fired

318
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:14,777
for getting some free coffee

319
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:17,488
while a prosecutor taking sex bribes

320
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:19,824
doesn't even get arrested

321
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:21,659
because the bribe is
less than a million won.

322
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:23,369
Watch it!

323
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,496
You left me for Sin-jin

324
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,456
and now, you want to come back?

325
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,083
Is this how...

326
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:37,049
Hold on.

327
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:39,302
So, the real reason

328
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:41,637
you left me to side with Sin-jin...

329
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:51,939
Hello?

330
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:54,317
Hello.

331
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,111
I'm Yu Seon-cheol from Haenal Law Firm.

332
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,329
What brings you to call me?

333
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,337
My daughter is building a great connection

334
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,089
with Mr. Lee,
the judge with whom you set her up.

335
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:19,383
Thanks to you,
I now have a great future son-in-law.

336
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:21,469
I'm sorry for thanking you so late.

337
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:24,138
Here.

338
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:29,852
I heard
Prosecutor General Eom joined Haenal.

339
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:33,272
Yes, he's our legal advisor.

340
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:34,857
We give him the best deal.

341
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:36,484
And thanks to him

342
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,070
Haenal will become the best in the field.

343
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:40,154
Oh, my.

344
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:42,615
We still have a long way to go.

345
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:45,785
But we'd certainly become the best
if we got

346
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:47,536
the head of the Judiciary with us, too.

347
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:49,789
Do you mean Chief Justice Jeon?

348
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:53,292
Han-young told me

349
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:57,755
Chief Justice Jeon would resign soon.

350
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:02,176
And you believe him?

351
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,552
Look at how things are going.

352
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:05,471
I believe him.

353
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,060
And

354
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:15,606
Mr. Jeon isn't the one I want.

355
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:18,234
If you'd like

356
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:21,195
I could help you get nominated

357
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,324
as the next Chief Justice.

358
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:49,348
Will you let me in
if I put my life on the line?

359
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:52,810
Seems like you've already put your life
on the line.

360
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:03,696
What are you doing?

361
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:05,698
I'm busy.

362
00:22:06,198 --> 00:22:07,199
You getting out?

363
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,792
Nice car.

364
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:18,836
Didn't know judges made a fortune.

365
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,310
I graduated second in my class.

366
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:35,686
Not only am I smart

367
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,771
but I've also got...

368
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:38,564
I graduated second in class
from Hanguk Law School.

369
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:40,107
Not only am I smart

370
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,567
but I have one hell of a temper, too.

371
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,069
You have a hell of a temper, too.

372
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,071
Did I tell you that?

373
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:47,114
You didn't need to tell me.

374
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,576
You have a good eye for people.

375
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:53,704
Trust this smart prosecutor

376
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:54,955
with a hell of a temper.

377
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:57,833
I don't care
if he's the beast or the devil.

378
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:00,753
I'll arrest him with Tae-sik
and crush them both.

379
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:02,129
You might bleed and be crushed

380
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,839
before you even get to them.

381
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:08,886
Tae-sik is the reason
I became a prosecutor.

382
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:11,972
I don't care if my skull splits
or my bone breaks.

383
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:16,143
I'll arrest him with my own hands
and bring him to trial.

384
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:18,687
I should be the judge, then.

385
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:20,898
Okay, let's team up.

386
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:22,691
You can crush them.

387
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:24,485
I'll break their necks.

388
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:30,366
The devil of the Judiciary
that we're going after is

389
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,912
the Senior Presiding Judge
at the Seoul Central Court

390
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:41,127
Mr. Kang Sin-jin.

391
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:44,922
Kang Sin-jin?

392
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:08,571
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

393
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:11,073
What happened when the world saw

394
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:13,159
the video of the big-name CEO doing drugs?

395
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:15,453
The whole nation recognized his face

396
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,580
except for the prosecution.

397
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,875
When a Governor's son got
five billion won in salary

398
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,335
the court considered it
to be lacking in reciprocity.

399
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:26,338
And Sin-jin has way more than that

400
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:29,383
but not even all evidence in the world
is enough to arrest him.

401
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,386
So, what's your plan?

402
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:34,054
Kidnap him?

403
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:36,640
I can't torture him
into confessing his illegal deeds.

404
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:42,146
Legal or illegal

405
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:43,522
I'll find my own way.

406
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:46,025
Can you do that?

407
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:56,076
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

408
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:00,789
Didn't you say you had plans?

409
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:02,208
Yeah.

410
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:05,002
I'm getting dinner with my parents.

411
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:10,216
And your parents live here?

412
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,718
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

413
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:14,428
You think

414
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,515
judges only come
from the richest areas in Gangnam?

415
00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:22,895
No, that's not what I mean.

416
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,581
Hello?

417
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:47,670
Do you need help?

418
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,964
Did your mom tell you to come?

419
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,301
Well...

420
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:00,933
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

421
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:03,894
Jin-a, are you really not going in?

422
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:05,062
Fine.

423
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:08,357
Stay here until the trial is over, then.

424
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:11,819
Let's get some beef once I'm done.

425
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:13,487
Korean beef, your favorite.

426
00:26:23,372 --> 00:26:24,373
The court hereby orders

427
00:26:25,457 --> 00:26:27,001
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

428
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:30,629
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

429
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:34,174
The Defendant has one week to appeal

430
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:37,094
to the court's decision
from the day of the announcement.

431
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,221
If an appeal is not filed

432
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:42,474
the decision will be carried out
as announced.

433
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:46,186
He was the boy there.

434
00:26:57,573 --> 00:26:58,574
Yes?

435
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:01,243
So, what's our first task

436
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:03,495
legal or illegal?

437
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,168
You want to try acting?

438
00:27:09,418 --> 00:27:12,296
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

439
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:15,841
Make sure you're ready.
I'll give you a sign to go.

440
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:17,051
Yes, sir.

441
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:20,387
This is

442
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,515
everything up to the final verdict.

443
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,434
Just read the script and dismiss the case.

444
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:28,729
Let's grab a drink at Manwol after.

445
00:27:29,688 --> 00:27:30,689
Sure.

446
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:48,540
Case Number 2025GD315.

447
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,959
The court will now deliver the verdict

448
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:54,254
on the insurance claim
by Plaintiff Yoon Ji-hye and two others

449
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:58,592
against Defendant SIC Life Insurance.

450
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,811
The facts of the indictment
are established by the following evidence.

451
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:11,689
BAEK YI-SEOK

452
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:20,030
How did it go?

453
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:22,783
The Plaintiff's claims were dismissed.

454
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,368
There's enough room

455
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:27,246
for the possibility of the father
to have died in an accident

456
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:30,082
but Judge Kim completely eliminated
that option.

457
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:35,546
And Haenal is representing the case?

458
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:36,672
Yes, sir.

459
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:39,091
The document Han-young brought to me

460
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:41,844
showed Haenal's connection to Sin-jin.

461
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:44,096
These jerks!

462
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,348
It's for sure, then.

463
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:03,323
Should we really go forward
with Mr. Hwang?

464
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:05,617
His reputation is terrible.

465
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:08,203
Endorsing him feels like a waste of money.

466
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,038
You going to be presumptuous, too?

467
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:15,753
I decide if it's a waste.

468
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,133
Go ahead with the plan.

469
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:22,593
Yes, sir.

470
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,441
Mr. Kang

471
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:40,569
it's been dismissed.

472
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,196
Is that right?

473
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:44,448
Okay.

474
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:49,495
Hey

475
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:51,789
I hear
the cryptocurrency scammers are in Korea.

476
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:56,877
They pay out fake returns
for about three months

477
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,670
to get you to invest more, right?

478
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,510
Maybe I can play it safe
and invest for just two months.

479
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:05,594
Why not?

480
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:07,054
Just two months...

481
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,141
Hey, I'll call you back.

482
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:12,267
Okay.

483
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:20,567
KIM JIN-A
CENTRAL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

484
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,156
Can't believe she's a prosecutor.

485
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:30,244
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

486
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,087
- Lunch?
- Can't. I'm on a diet.

487
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,422
Perfect.
I'm also trying to lose some weight.

488
00:30:42,506 --> 00:30:44,508
How about some coffee? You down?

489
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:50,264
You can't make me do anything anymore.
Don't even try.

490
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:56,603
Why are you like that?

491
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,272
Jin-a arrested Gyo-hun's daughter

492
00:30:58,355 --> 00:30:59,565
so why can't you tell me?

493
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,692
Who's that great evil of the Judiciary?

494
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:03,026
Oh, that?

495
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:05,404
I already told Jin-a who that is.

496
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:07,114
What?

497
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,368
Senior Presiding Judge Kang Sin-jin

498
00:31:12,452 --> 00:31:15,831
at the Seoul Central District Court.

499
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,587
Was he behind Mr. Kang Jeong-tae's death

500
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,005
and that attack on me, too?

501
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:24,464
It's over now.

502
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,927
He's a hired murderer for Sin-jin.

503
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:33,640
That's not a judge. That's the devil.

504
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:36,143
We can't just get him.

505
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:38,604
Shouldn't we wear armor or something?

506
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:39,938
It's too dangerous.

507
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,899
That's why I've teamed up with Jin-a.

508
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:43,859
We'll break his neck

509
00:31:43,942 --> 00:31:45,694
before he breaks ours.

510
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:47,237
And just how will you do that?

511
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,072
Are you helping me?

512
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:51,158
Didn't you come here to ask me
for help, anyway?

513
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:52,242
You okay

514
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:53,619
with risking your life?

515
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:12,971
TAEGYEONG BIO

516
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:15,807
I even used my daughter's tuition
without telling my wife.

517
00:32:16,683 --> 00:32:18,101
This can't be real.

518
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:20,562
Oh?

519
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:22,147
Mr. Lee?

520
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,815
Oh, hey, Mr. Park.

521
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:25,692
Nice seeing you!

522
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:29,237
Didn't expect to see you here.
I only ever see you in court.

523
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:32,115
I was watching you there.
You looked like a pro.

524
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:33,492
Are you going pro soon?

525
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:36,620
I've been playing golf for a decade now.

526
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:38,163
You any good?

527
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:39,790
I'm a golf noob.

528
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:41,625
- What?
- A newbie at golf.

529
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:45,087
Not a boob. A noob.

530
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:54,763
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A

531
00:32:58,517 --> 00:32:59,851
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

532
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:02,562
Hey, I'll call you back.

533
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:03,647
Okay.

534
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:11,321
Here's your coffee, sir.

535
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:15,325
This little brat.

536
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:18,495
What's wrong?

537
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:21,832
She's a colleague,
and she won't leave me alone.

538
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,668
I don't mean to snoop

539
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:27,337
but is she begging for your love?

540
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:30,007
Begging for my love? I wish.

541
00:33:30,924 --> 00:33:32,134
It's nothing like that.

542
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:33,218
Come on.

543
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,849
International investment scams are

544
00:33:38,932 --> 00:33:39,933
in Gangnam now.

545
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,686
And she wants to invest some money
into their scheme.

546
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:45,814
Can't believe
how greedy this young one is.

547
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:48,400
Wait.

548
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,987
How can you scam the scammers?

549
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,321
Here's how.

550
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:56,408
Before they run away with your money

551
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,661
they build trust with you
by paying you all the interest

552
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,621
for about three months.

553
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:02,789
So, take your money out

554
00:34:02,873 --> 00:34:04,958
before they run away with it,
and you earn money.

555
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,877
It's a 10% return per month.

556
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:10,005
10%?

557
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:23,560
How did it go?

558
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,068
He was ready to invest immediately.

559
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:33,528
Don't make me do this again, alright?

560
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:37,240
Seong-dae's loan began to snowball around
this time due to stocks.

561
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,242
He'll bite the bait soon enough.

562
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:42,621
SEONHWAGAK

563
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:49,795
I want to know why you gave me

564
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,755
Tae-seong's job application scores.

565
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,971
Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

566
00:35:01,973 --> 00:35:04,226
It was the first time you asked me
for anything.

567
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:05,393
I had to get it for you.

568
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:07,813
Once Tae-seong gets arrested

569
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:11,233
it'll be hard for Justice Hwang
to become the Chief Justice.

570
00:35:11,316 --> 00:35:12,776
That could be true.

571
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:17,656
No.

572
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:20,617
There's no way Sin-jin will give up
on Nam-yong.

573
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:22,536
How does it feel

574
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,330
watching a Justice being chased
by the press?

575
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:27,499
Do you feel satisfied?

576
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,584
It's only the beginning.

577
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,961
That's right.

578
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:33,630
Forget your benefactors,
but never forget your enemies.

579
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:35,924
If you forget who helped you

580
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:37,968
you'll just be called a jerk.

581
00:35:38,051 --> 00:35:40,387
But you forget your enemy,
and you'll fall again.

582
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:50,897
But are you sure you can handle it?

583
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:52,482
I have to do whatever it takes

584
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,526
to make Nam-yong the Chief Justice.

585
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:57,654
However it ends, you'll be happy.

586
00:35:59,072 --> 00:36:00,157
If I succeed

587
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:02,951
you'll be proud of me
for the successful revenge.

588
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:04,786
If I fail

589
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,913
you'll gain

590
00:36:07,414 --> 00:36:09,624
the Chief Justice on your side.

591
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:11,668
Is that how it is?

592
00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:16,089
I guess that's fun both ways.

593
00:36:43,158 --> 00:36:45,577
You cast the bait yourself

594
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,579
so hunt him yourself, too.

595
00:36:48,455 --> 00:36:50,957
Transfer to the Criminal Division
and take Tae-seong's case.

596
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:52,709
Sorry?

597
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:54,878
Why? You don't want to do that?

598
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:56,963
No.

599
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:00,383
I'll do my best

600
00:37:00,842 --> 00:37:02,219
in whatever you tell me to do.

601
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:03,845
Okay.

602
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:07,057
Let's both do our best for our goals.

603
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:32,207
Did he see me?

604
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:40,715
The guy you were with earlier.

605
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:44,010
Is that the guy?

606
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,474
Mr. Lee?

607
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,603
Change of plans.

608
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:57,399
You won't see him again.

609
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:02,320
Yes, sir.

610
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,084
What are you doing?

611
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:18,003
Welcome.

612
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:20,422
Why are you welcoming me at my own store?

613
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:24,134
What's there to see?

614
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:27,429
Na-yeong has midterms.

615
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,056
Wow.

616
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:31,641
She's studying hard.

617
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:33,518
Oh, my stomach!

618
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:34,769
Gosh, it hurts so much.

619
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:38,315
It's from the samgak gimbap
I bought at this store.

620
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,609
I think they sell expired food.

621
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,696
I'm just here for some cigs.

622
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,658
- Quit smoking.
- What?

623
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:49,826
Just quit.

624
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:52,245
Don't smoke.

625
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:55,040
"It kills you and those around you."

626
00:38:56,624 --> 00:38:57,709
Well

627
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,669
if you insist you want to die

628
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:00,837
I can help you with that.

629
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:04,341
He's a really scary guy.

630
00:39:04,424 --> 00:39:05,425
Look at his big guns.

631
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:08,678
They're so big
that he can't even roll up his sleeves.

632
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:13,099
I'll quit smoking.

633
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,602
- You'd better.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:39:16,102 --> 00:39:17,103
Goodnight.

635
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:18,605
Good luck!

636
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:27,322
- Thank you for coming.
- It was great.

637
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:30,909
Thank you! Come again.

638
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:32,285
- Jeong-ho!
- Huh?

639
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,995
- Water.
- Can't you read the sign?

640
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,663
"Please get your own water."

641
00:39:35,747 --> 00:39:37,123
You were too spoiled growing up.

642
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,668
Hey, I'm heading out for a delivery.

643
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:44,130
Okay! I'm taking
all the cash you make today.

644
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:45,215
Are you stupid?

645
00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:47,258
Everyone pays with cards. There's no cash.

646
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:48,343
Gosh, you dummy.

647
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,929
That's what I'm saying!

648
00:39:52,972 --> 00:39:54,641
You stupid or what?

649
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,810
How are you a building owner
with that brain?

650
00:39:57,602 --> 00:39:58,603
You want to know?

651
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,480
Want me to tell you?

652
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,916
I bought the building
with the money I earned with hard work.

653
00:40:24,129 --> 00:40:26,047
I don't need a building.

654
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:31,678
Fly!

655
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,768
What are you doing?

656
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:41,563
Pick them up right now!

657
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:42,689
Fly!

658
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:44,190
Fly!

659
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:45,817
CLOSED FOR THE DAY
THANK YOU

660
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:55,660
I just realized

661
00:40:56,744 --> 00:40:59,998
my fingers' nerves are connected
to my wrists.

662
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,128
What a pathetic neural network.

663
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:06,463
It's okay.

664
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:08,923
A judge just needs to talk.
You don't need hands.

665
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,633
Hey!

666
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:12,510
No job requires

667
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:15,221
more reading and writing
than being a judge.

668
00:41:15,763 --> 00:41:17,765
Really? That's too bad.

669
00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:19,017
Good luck!

670
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,853
Man, that hurts.

671
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:28,067
Oh, my.

672
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,111
I can't believe you did the dishes.

673
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:33,740
Are you sure this is okay?

674
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:35,658
Of course. Hand it over already.

675
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:37,785
Okay, this is for me.

676
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:41,498
Let's see.

677
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:48,213
Wow!

678
00:41:48,296 --> 00:41:51,883
The minimum wage is
finally 10,000 won per hour!

679
00:41:53,259 --> 00:41:54,260
Here.

680
00:41:54,761 --> 00:41:57,805
The minimum wage in 2025 is 10,030 won.

681
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:00,600
You worked for two hours,
which means you get 20,060 won.

682
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:01,684
Here.

683
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:06,356
- Give me my money.
- Treat yourself.

684
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:07,982
Preferably at my convenience store.

685
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:12,153
I can't use this precious money.

686
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:14,322
Really? I'll use it, then.

687
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:16,032
Stop it before I break your wrist.

688
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:18,284
You can't even use yours right now.

689
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,453
Here. Just have some sundae.

690
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:21,996
Open up.

691
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:23,248
Good boy!

692
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:27,460
- Give me some soju.
- Soju?

693
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:28,545
Soju.

694
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:29,879
Here, Your Honor.

695
00:42:29,963 --> 00:42:31,464
Delicious, huh?

696
00:42:33,466 --> 00:42:34,467
Hey

697
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:37,512
the stage and the actors are all ready.

698
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:38,763
When's the show happening?

699
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:43,059
Soon!

700
00:42:43,142 --> 00:42:47,647
MIRACLE ASIA 2025 GLOBAL INVESTMENT EVENT

701
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:52,527
There he is.

702
00:42:57,073 --> 00:43:00,785
MIRACLE ASIA 2025 GLOBAL INVESTMENT EVENT

703
00:43:04,747 --> 00:43:06,332
Hi, everyone!

704
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,710
My name is Brian.

705
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:11,838
I'm

706
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:13,756
Brian.

707
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:17,260
I'm the man

708
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:20,888
who will make you

709
00:43:21,347 --> 00:43:22,682
rich.

710
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:29,147
Brian?

711
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,690
Rich, my ass.

712
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:34,068
You all get scammed
because you want free money.

713
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:38,698
Sounds good, right?

714
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:40,867
Hey, that's Ms. Yu Se-hee
of Haenal Law Firm.

715
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,869
Yeah, the girl who slapped that judge.

716
00:43:43,411 --> 00:43:45,288
This must be a legitimate thing

717
00:43:45,371 --> 00:43:47,332
if someone from Haenal is here, right?

718
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,585
Why not?

719
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:54,631
What's wrong with Asia?

720
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:57,759
Over four billion people go nuts

721
00:43:57,842 --> 00:44:01,179
for K-pop, K-drama, and K-food!

722
00:44:01,262 --> 00:44:02,347
Absolutely nuts!

723
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,640
Oh, nuts. I'm sorry.

724
00:44:05,224 --> 00:44:06,225
How should I put it?

725
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:07,894
- Is it going well?
- If not Asia

726
00:44:07,977 --> 00:44:09,771
the continent

727
00:44:09,854 --> 00:44:11,606
the world is raving about now

728
00:44:11,689 --> 00:44:13,983
where would you invest in?

729
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:15,068
Right?

730
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:16,361
- Brian!
- Brian!

731
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:21,449
- Brian, Brian!
- Brian, Brian!

732
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:23,868
What the hell is this?

733
00:44:24,535 --> 00:44:25,828
You want me to invest in this?

734
00:44:25,912 --> 00:44:27,246
Just stay there for a bit.

735
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:31,084
You need to do this
to bring Yi-seok to Haenal.

736
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,920
Long time ago

737
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:36,547
there was the Silk Road

738
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:39,342
to make people rich. But now

739
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:43,596
you have the Miracle A-Token Road!

740
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:51,396
All you need is to get ready.

741
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:52,480
To be rich!

742
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:54,524
So many reporters are here, too.

743
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:57,068
I'd better invest some money
before everyone else does.

744
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:58,194
Same.

745
00:44:58,277 --> 00:44:59,821
- Where is he?
- Excuse me!

746
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,741
As you can see

747
00:45:03,825 --> 00:45:06,744
we're developing a cryptocurrency
that four billion people will use.

748
00:45:06,828 --> 00:45:10,331
We guarantee 10% in return every month.

749
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:11,791
So, within a year...

750
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:13,751
- You sure about the 10%?
- Yes.

751
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:18,506
- Hey.
- Hey, Han-young.

752
00:45:19,132 --> 00:45:20,883
Seong-dae was here just now

753
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:22,510
but only invested 100 million won.

754
00:45:22,635 --> 00:45:25,304
Isn't that too little for a guy
who has three billion won?

755
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:26,806
Or did we just not do a good job?

756
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:28,224
He's very careful.

757
00:45:28,307 --> 00:45:30,393
Send him 10% in profit when I tell you to.

758
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:32,270
He'll fall for it right away.

759
00:45:33,146 --> 00:45:36,357
First, I changed Mr. Hwang's car

760
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:38,192
to a used compact sedan.

761
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:41,487
And I'm looking for a humble home
near Sinyeong-dong.

762
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:44,866
It's taking some time to find
the donation recipient

763
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:48,786
that'll lie about Mr. Hwang having donated
to them for five years.

764
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:52,123
Donate 300 million won. Don't be late.

765
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:54,167
Yes, Mr. Kang.

766
00:45:57,336 --> 00:45:58,671
You having a good day?

767
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:03,676
We're preparing a future Chief Justice.

768
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:05,428
I'm just nervous.

769
00:46:07,221 --> 00:46:08,473
No need to be nervous.

770
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:10,933
Don't mess up.

771
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:12,393
Yes, sir.

772
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:23,571
Case Number 2025GD2203.

773
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:25,990
We'll now begin the trial
for Defendant Hwang Tae-seong

774
00:46:26,073 --> 00:46:28,826
on charges of obstruction of business
and document forgery.

775
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:40,671
JUSTICE HWANG NAM-YONG

776
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:47,762
JUSTICE HWANG NAM-YONG

777
00:46:47,845 --> 00:46:50,181
Your call cannot be completed.
Please leave a message...

778
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,186
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

779
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:02,235
Your call cannot be completed.
Please leave a message...

780
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:15,665
PARKING SPOT FOR JUSTICE

781
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:42,859
BOSS

782
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,111
You wrote the article on Tae-seong.

783
00:47:45,194 --> 00:47:46,904
Why don't you want to attend his trial?

784
00:47:47,363 --> 00:47:49,740
Why would I go there on a day like today?

785
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:51,367
What am I, an amateur?

786
00:47:51,826 --> 00:47:52,869
What?

787
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:54,662
Where are you now, then?

788
00:47:55,746 --> 00:47:57,874
Investigate first, report later.

789
00:47:57,957 --> 00:47:59,625
I'll report it to you later.

790
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:05,590
Where is Justice Hwang going

791
00:48:05,673 --> 00:48:07,425
when his son is in trial?

792
00:48:12,638 --> 00:48:15,266
Kim Yun-cheol will be the next President.

793
00:48:16,017 --> 00:48:17,852
The screening for the next cabinet is

794
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:20,187
already underway.

795
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:29,196
I acquired a Canadian mining company.

796
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,532
The plan is to invest 100 billion won
from my group.

797
00:48:31,616 --> 00:48:33,743
If there's no profit in a year

798
00:48:33,826 --> 00:48:35,119
it'll go bankrupt

799
00:48:35,202 --> 00:48:36,579
wasting 100 billion won.

800
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:40,291
Recommend me
a Commissioner of the National Tax Service

801
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:42,335
and a Trade, Industry,
and Resources Minister.

802
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:46,047
And the Environment and Labor Minister.

803
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:48,758
My, my.

804
00:48:50,468 --> 00:48:51,969
You get more greedy with age.

805
00:48:52,053 --> 00:48:53,721
That greed got you

806
00:48:53,804 --> 00:48:56,390
in that very seat, didn't it?

807
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:59,060
All the power goes to you

808
00:48:59,143 --> 00:49:01,979
and all the money to me, Jang Yong-hyeon.

809
00:49:02,063 --> 00:49:05,107
That very greed created our Suojae.

810
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:06,817
My gosh, Mr. Jang.

811
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:08,819
Fine, then.

812
00:49:09,904 --> 00:49:12,239
You can choose
up to the Environment and Labor Minister.

813
00:49:13,532 --> 00:49:14,700
I wouldn't ask for more.

814
00:49:27,546 --> 00:49:29,840
I can't trust Mr. Kang.

815
00:49:30,174 --> 00:49:31,884
He told me not to worry at all

816
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,469
but he's ignoring all my calls!

817
00:49:33,844 --> 00:49:35,388
I don't understand

818
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:36,889
where this is going at all.

819
00:49:38,015 --> 00:49:39,433
No need to understand it.

820
00:49:40,518 --> 00:49:41,519
Sorry?

821
00:49:41,686 --> 00:49:43,980
If Sin-jin says it'll be done,
it'll be done.

822
00:49:45,272 --> 00:49:46,649
Since you're here

823
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:50,611
just have some tea.

824
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,572
Defendant Hwang Tae-seong applied to work

825
00:50:34,655 --> 00:50:37,241
at JB Daehan Construction
on October 14, 2024

826
00:50:37,324 --> 00:50:40,161
with fake work experience
in his application.

827
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:42,288
Therefore, the Defendant

828
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:46,250
obstructed the company's business
with fraudulent information.

829
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:51,088
Why did Sin-jin really leave me
to take Tae-seong's case?

830
00:50:52,465 --> 00:50:54,633
Is Sin-jin the only one

831
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:57,762
who wants Nam-yong to become
the Chief Justice?

832
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:03,517
Hey.

833
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:07,480
Hey

834
00:51:08,522 --> 00:51:10,107
what's your plan now?

835
00:51:11,108 --> 00:51:13,235
- With what?
- What else?

836
00:51:13,694 --> 00:51:15,362
Justice Hwang's son's life is

837
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:17,073
right in your hands.

838
00:51:17,782 --> 00:51:20,326
It's like you won the lottery.

839
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:22,536
I can't believe you.

840
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:24,288
Hey

841
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:25,831
did he not call you?

842
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:28,959
He did, didn't he?

843
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,296
He definitely called you.

844
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:34,173
So, what's in it for you?

845
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:35,591
You haven't had lunch, right?

846
00:51:35,674 --> 00:51:37,259
Why don't we talk over lunch?

847
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,762
Do you still not have a lunch buddy here?

848
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,268
I have many. I have them lined up!

849
00:51:47,144 --> 00:51:50,397
Isn't it so nice of me to visit you
for old time's sake?

850
00:51:54,568 --> 00:51:56,737
You can stop shaving that.

851
00:51:56,821 --> 00:51:58,948
Don't be so old.
I'll buy you a mechanical pencil.

852
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:02,910
You know what gets longer,
the more you shave?

853
00:52:06,413 --> 00:52:08,290
What are you even talking about?

854
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:09,917
What, the pencil lead?

855
00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:11,460
Correct!

856
00:52:11,836 --> 00:52:13,671
It's for you. Take it and go.

857
00:52:23,889 --> 00:52:24,890
Hey

858
00:52:25,182 --> 00:52:26,475
you can have all of these.

859
00:52:26,892 --> 00:52:28,144
I'll stick to mechanical.

860
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,354
Gosh.

861
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,743
The lead paradoxically becomes longer
the more it's shaved

862
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:46,954
because the secret is
that shaving it is different

863
00:52:47,037 --> 00:52:49,248
from it getting longer.

864
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:54,753
It's also a paradox
that Sin-jin threw Tae-seong at me

865
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:57,882
when he wants to make Nam-yong
the Chief Justice.

866
00:52:58,716 --> 00:53:02,303
And I must find the answer in it.

867
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:08,017
TAEGYEONG BIO

868
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,602
MARKET VALUE: 137,352,000 WON

869
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:11,312
58,200 WON PER UNIT

870
00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:28,495
I hear Taegyeong Bio is
at the brink of delisting.

871
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:30,789
Mr. Lee also told me
to buy some shares for it.

872
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:31,916
Did you?

873
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,418
I'm barely paying my mortgage on time.

874
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:36,170
TAEGYEONG BIO,
FOUND TO BE A WITHDRAWN COMPANY

875
00:53:39,965 --> 00:53:40,966
Send Mr. Lee

876
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:43,010
10 million won in 30 minutes.

877
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:45,095
"Trading suspended"?

878
00:53:45,804 --> 00:53:46,847
The market value...

879
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,226
No!

880
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:51,310
TRADING SUSPENDED

881
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:52,394
No!

882
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:53,562
My 400 million won!

883
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:54,813
TAEGYEONG BIO DELISTED

884
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:56,941
How do I tell my wife?

885
00:53:58,776 --> 00:54:00,861
That's our daughter's tuition.

886
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:05,866
WIFE

887
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,665
Hey.

888
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:15,793
You know Seon-yeong's allowance
and tuition for next month?

889
00:54:15,876 --> 00:54:18,671
Why don't we send the money in advance
when the dollar is cheaper?

890
00:54:19,213 --> 00:54:21,966
You called me mid-day
just because the dollar is cheap?

891
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:23,968
I'm busy. Let's talk later.

892
00:54:29,473 --> 00:54:30,975
Oh, no.

893
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,227
You're calling again?

894
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,645
MIRACLE ASIA (SCAM)

895
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:40,067
Hello?

896
00:54:40,818 --> 00:54:42,945
Hello, Mr. Lee Seong-dae.

897
00:54:43,028 --> 00:54:44,571
I'm calling from Miracle Asia.

898
00:54:44,655 --> 00:54:47,199
I'm calling about the profit you made
earlier than expected.

899
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,284
Sorry?

900
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:50,327
We'll send you the money right now.

901
00:54:50,411 --> 00:54:51,412
Good luck!

902
00:54:53,497 --> 00:54:55,416
NOTIFICATION FROM SEBIT BANK

903
00:54:55,499 --> 00:54:57,251
SEBIT BANK

904
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,131
MIRACLE ASIA

905
00:55:02,214 --> 00:55:03,882
AMOUNT RECEIVED: 10,000,000 WON

906
00:55:05,718 --> 00:55:06,844
INVESTMENT RETURNS FROM MIRACLE ASIA

907
00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:09,888
INVESTMENT RETURNS FROM MIRACLE ASIA

908
00:55:16,228 --> 00:55:17,813
SINHYEOP BANK

909
00:55:18,355 --> 00:55:20,524
ACCOUNT BALANCE: 2.9 BILLION WON

910
00:55:21,608 --> 00:55:22,860
Yeah

911
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:24,945
there's always a way out.

912
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,741
10% of 3 billion won is
300 million won a month

913
00:55:28,824 --> 00:55:30,159
and 600 million in two.

914
00:55:30,242 --> 00:55:32,578
That makes up for the 400 million I lost
from investing

915
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:33,954
and still leaves 200 million.

916
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:37,166
I can just borrow money for a month
for Seon-yeong.

917
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,545
ACCOUNT BALANCE: 2.9 BILLION WON

918
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,425
Hello, Mr. Park.

919
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:48,052
What brings you all the way here?

920
00:55:48,135 --> 00:55:49,136
Here, have some coffee.

921
00:55:50,596 --> 00:55:51,638
Well

922
00:55:53,057 --> 00:55:56,810
about the foreign cryptocurrency fraud
you mentioned last time.

923
00:55:56,894 --> 00:55:57,895
Yeah?

924
00:55:58,896 --> 00:56:01,732
I have some money to spare.

925
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:04,068
Mr. Park.

926
00:56:04,151 --> 00:56:05,861
- You can't do that!
- What?

927
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,905
I'd suggest you not get into that.

928
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:10,657
There's no way you can handle
whatever issue this may cause.

929
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:13,077
It's really not that much.

930
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,914
I won't blame you,
not even if I lose all my money.

931
00:56:16,997 --> 00:56:19,249
Just shoot me a text

932
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,210
before you get those guys.

933
00:56:22,336 --> 00:56:25,047
I can't give out details
on an ongoing investigation...

934
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,924
I won't ever mention your name

935
00:56:27,007 --> 00:56:29,885
not even if my life depends on it.

936
00:56:30,302 --> 00:56:31,303
Please?

937
00:56:33,847 --> 00:56:35,224
Do you need the money that bad?

938
00:56:41,939 --> 00:56:43,982
I told him we'd strike in about two months

939
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:45,776
and promised to give him a heads-up.

940
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,444
Good work.

941
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:49,905
Mr. Lee, look at this.

942
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:54,535
Suojae?

943
00:56:55,327 --> 00:56:57,579
This was where Nam-yong went?

944
00:56:57,663 --> 00:57:00,416
Yeah, but that's not all.

945
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:02,835
I checked the owner of the vehicle
leaving here

946
00:57:03,293 --> 00:57:05,003
and it was Mr. Jang Yong-hyeon.

947
00:57:05,796 --> 00:57:08,382
And he took a bag out of that car.

948
00:57:08,882 --> 00:57:09,883
What do you think it has?

949
00:57:09,967 --> 00:57:10,968
Money, probably?

950
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:15,722
Do you know who lives here?

951
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:18,809
Of course.

952
00:57:19,726 --> 00:57:22,354
I looked into it on my way here.

953
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:30,154
Don't pass out from shock or anything.

954
00:57:30,237 --> 00:57:31,238
Okay.

955
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,075
The former President

956
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:37,411
Mr. Park Gwang-to.

957
00:57:42,624 --> 00:57:43,667
Wow.

958
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:59,141
- You sure?
- Yeah.

959
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,977
You have no idea how shocked I was.

960
00:58:02,436 --> 00:58:04,438
This is something I didn't know
in my past life.

961
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:08,275
Mr. Park Gwang-to, the former President,
had Sin-jin's back all along!

962
00:58:12,779 --> 00:58:13,780
By the way

963
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:17,367
can I write an article about this...

964
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:18,785
Let's keep it a secret for now.

965
00:58:29,296 --> 00:58:31,965
SECRETARY KIM, FUTURE TALENTS FOUNDATION

966
00:58:32,132 --> 00:58:33,133
Hello?

967
00:58:33,217 --> 00:58:34,968
Hello, Mr. Lee.

968
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,513
I'm the secretary
at the Future Talents Foundation.

969
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,308
It's about the donation
you mentioned last time.

970
00:58:41,391 --> 00:58:43,977
I can tweak the ledger a bit

971
00:58:44,061 --> 00:58:46,438
and change the donation period
to five years.

972
00:58:47,648 --> 00:58:48,649
Really?

973
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:51,818
You'll be donating 300 million won, right?

974
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:53,862
Yeah, sure.

975
00:58:54,154 --> 00:58:55,405
Yes, 300 million won.

976
00:58:57,241 --> 00:58:59,201
Get the Investigation Task Force ready.

977
00:59:05,457 --> 00:59:06,625
You wanted to see me?

978
00:59:07,334 --> 00:59:09,545
Weren't you scared

979
00:59:09,628 --> 00:59:12,214
knowing Hee-young's father was
the Justice Minister nominee?

980
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:14,633
It was your order.

981
00:59:14,716 --> 00:59:15,968
Of course, I'd follow it.

982
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:20,430
Come with me.

983
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:23,058
I'll put your name
on the case report, too.

984
00:59:26,853 --> 00:59:27,854
What?

985
00:59:30,232 --> 00:59:32,192
Where are we going?

986
00:59:32,609 --> 00:59:33,735
To Gangnam.

987
00:59:33,819 --> 00:59:36,238
I was tipped off
about Asian investment frauds.

988
00:59:36,822 --> 00:59:38,115
They're from Miracle Asia.

989
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:41,326
They've even held
an investment seminar already.

990
00:59:42,536 --> 00:59:43,704
Why are you so surprised?

991
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:47,583
I just can't believe
people still pull that trick.

992
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:49,751
Money drives the world.

993
00:59:49,835 --> 00:59:51,336
New ones will keep coming.

994
00:59:52,129 --> 00:59:53,130
Right.

995
00:59:58,176 --> 00:59:59,303
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

996
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:01,847
CALLING JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

997
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:05,434
We'll be there in about ten.

998
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:08,061
Arriving in ten.

999
01:00:08,145 --> 01:00:09,146
Get ready.

1000
01:00:09,521 --> 01:00:10,564
Yes, sir.

1001
01:00:14,192 --> 01:00:16,361
We have nine more minutes to go.

1002
01:00:20,198 --> 01:00:21,241
Hey, Jeong-ho.

1003
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:22,534
What? The prosecution?

1004
01:00:23,076 --> 01:00:24,077
Right now?

1005
01:00:39,593 --> 01:00:41,386
Come sooner, Seong-dae.

1006
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,180
My Seong-dae.

1007
01:01:12,376 --> 01:01:14,086
What the hell is he doing?

1008
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:30,852
Just let him go.

1009
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:32,312
Is he drunk or something?

1010
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:47,077
Oh, my neck!

1011
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:49,371
Are you kidding me?

1012
01:01:49,454 --> 01:01:51,164
I told you to just let him go!

1013
01:01:51,248 --> 01:01:53,542
How dare that bastard get in my way?

1014
01:01:56,002 --> 01:01:58,088
Did you learn to drive on Mario Kart?

1015
01:01:58,505 --> 01:01:59,506
Hey!

1016
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:01,758
Did you learn to drive on Mario Kart?

1017
01:02:01,842 --> 01:02:03,802
You think
the blinkers make everything okay?

1018
01:02:04,511 --> 01:02:05,554
Are you okay?

1019
01:02:05,846 --> 01:02:06,930
Of course.

1020
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:10,142
"Of course"?

1021
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:12,269
You're kidding me!

1022
01:02:12,352 --> 01:02:14,438
The world doesn't need any of this!

1023
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:16,106
No need to get that insulting.

1024
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:19,276
So what?

1025
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:20,402
- Huh?
- What?

1026
01:02:20,485 --> 01:02:22,279
Watch your language, alright?

1027
01:02:22,362 --> 01:02:24,072
- Did you just cuss?
- Hey!

1028
01:02:24,156 --> 01:02:25,741
Let's just get going, okay?

1029
01:02:25,824 --> 01:02:27,242
No, just stay in your seat!

1030
01:02:28,243 --> 01:02:29,745
I'll take care of it myself.

1031
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:31,872
Get in.

1032
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,668
What were you thinking?

1033
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:38,837
Wow.

1034
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,798
They were right about her being a witch.

1035
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:46,136
We don't have time for this!

1036
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:53,310
Hello, are you Mr. Lee Seong-dae?

1037
01:02:53,393 --> 01:02:54,603
- Yes.
- This way, please.

1038
01:02:58,023 --> 01:02:59,024
Come in.

1039
01:03:01,026 --> 01:03:02,527
- Hello.
- Oh, my!

1040
01:03:03,069 --> 01:03:04,988
- Hello, sir.
- Here comes our investor.

1041
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:06,698
- How have you been?
- I've been well.

1042
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:07,783
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

1043
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:08,867
- Is coffee okay?
- Yes.

1044
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,327
Two coffees, please.

1045
01:03:14,122 --> 01:03:15,707
TAEGYEON BANK

1046
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:17,292
RECEIVED 2,900,000,000 WON
FROM LEE SEONG-DAE

1047
01:03:20,253 --> 01:03:21,630
We've received your money.

1048
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:24,591
That's 3 billion won,
including the initial 100 million.

1049
01:03:24,674 --> 01:03:27,093
You'll get 300 million won in profit
next month.

1050
01:03:28,678 --> 01:03:29,679
Hurry.

1051
01:03:29,763 --> 01:03:31,097
Okay, that's all for today...

1052
01:03:31,181 --> 01:03:32,182
Wait.

1053
01:03:35,644 --> 01:03:36,645
About

1054
01:03:38,063 --> 01:03:40,148
next month's profit.

1055
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:43,276
Can I invest that, too?

1056
01:03:44,986 --> 01:03:46,738
Of course.

1057
01:03:46,822 --> 01:03:48,573
Would you like that?

1058
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:51,284
10% of 300 million won is 30 million.

1059
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:04,464
APK BUILDING

1060
01:04:13,682 --> 01:04:14,766
Oh, no!

1061
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,643
- What's wrong?
- My back!

1062
01:04:16,726 --> 01:04:18,436
It's from the earlier crash.

1063
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,689
- Just stay out of it, then.
- Oh, no.

1064
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:21,773
Stay here, alright?

1065
01:04:22,315 --> 01:04:23,692
HAN-YOUNG

1066
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:30,699
Your call cannot be completed.

1067
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:00,353
He took the elevator just now. Hurry!

1068
01:05:00,437 --> 01:05:01,605
Yes, sir.

1069
01:05:01,813 --> 01:05:03,940
Oh, come on. I have to take the stairs?

1070
01:05:05,567 --> 01:05:08,486
The profit is coming a whole month later

1071
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,114
so just let me know before that,
and I'll take care of it.

1072
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:13,158
I'm late for something right now

1073
01:05:13,241 --> 01:05:14,284
so let's wrap it up.

1074
01:05:14,784 --> 01:05:16,578
That's 60 million in two months, then.

1075
01:05:16,661 --> 01:05:19,456
What? Of course.
It's 30 million won per month.

1076
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:21,291
I really have to go now.

1077
01:05:38,975 --> 01:05:40,310
The prosecution is here!

1078
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:52,030
THE JUDGE RETURNS

1079
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:19,099
What do you say? It's a chance
to join the real power circle.

1080
01:06:19,182 --> 01:06:21,351
Announce Tae-seong as not guilty.

1081
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:22,852
It's just a small entry fee for that.

1082
01:06:22,936 --> 01:06:25,730
I'm not conducting a trial.
It's a hostage situation.

1083
01:06:25,814 --> 01:06:28,233
Just be patient. I'll be right over.

1084
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:30,193
Guard him, no matter what. Strike first.

1085
01:06:30,276 --> 01:06:31,611
I'm Seok Jeong-ho, alright?

1086
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:33,071
Can you handle it?

1087
01:06:33,154 --> 01:06:34,572
You'll become the Chief Justice.

1088
01:06:34,656 --> 01:06:36,491
You'll never become the Chief Justice.

1089
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:38,284
Whose word do you think weighs more?

1090
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:39,661
I'm the one giving you a chance.

1091
01:06:39,744 --> 01:06:41,454
- You told me to trust you!
- No!

1092
01:06:41,538 --> 01:06:42,872
Those crazy bastards!

1093
01:06:42,956 --> 01:06:44,457
You've really lost your mind.

1094
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:46,292
One slip, and it's game over.

1095
01:06:48,962 --> 01:06:50,964
