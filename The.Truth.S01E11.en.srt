Si Yuanlong.

4
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:42,759
What is it?

5
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:43,800
Nothing.

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,720
Do you remember our bet last time?

7
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,880
Of course. What do you want me to do?

8
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,119
Let me be clear.

9
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,119
Don't push it.

10
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,240
I wouldn't.

11
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,960
It's actually about that volunteer event
the No-Name Diner keeps organizing.

12
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,080
I want you to join in.
Are you interested in it?

13
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,240
Just that?

14
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,320
So did you ask me,
or did he let you ask me?

15
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,759
Well...

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,840
Since when do you care
who asks you to volunteer?

17
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,959
What?

18
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,840
If I ask you, you won't go?

19
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,400
But if Little Qian asks, you'll go?

20
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,959
It's Little Qian who asks.

21
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:34,959
Fine. I'll go.

22
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,040
Volunteering is a good thing.

23
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,799
I'm really speechless.

24
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,239
Alright then, go ahead. I'm heading out.

25
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:44,959
Remember to go.

(Roman International)

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,720
Chen Zhi.

28
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,479
We have some questions.

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,320
Based on DNA comparison,

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,199
the deceased is your father,
Chen Daning.

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,239
He's really dead?

32
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,600
Then just do whatever you have to do.

33
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,479
What kind of attitude is that?

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,280
He was your biological father.

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,040
Right.

36
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,199
Biologically. And that's all.

37
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,000
You're not suspecting me, are you?

38
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:35,919
Our shop's anniversary is this month.

39
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,359
I'm busy all day long.

40
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:39,224
At the shop by day,
back to the dorm at night.

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,199
My manager and colleagues
can vouch for me.

42
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,440
Nothing more to say. I'm leaving.

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,519
Wait.

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,040
Tell us about Chen Daning.

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,000
Like what?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,359
What could I possibly say?

47
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,624
Then we'll talk at the police station.

48
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,519
What about your mother? Tell us.

49
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,840
She died the year I graduated.

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,519
Why?

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,639
Haven't you investigated long enough

52
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,959
to know exactly
what kind of scum Chen Daning was?

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,080
I don't want to say
a single word about him.

54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,640
If you really want to know,
go ask around the village.

55
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,040
I left as soon as my mom died.

56
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,479
He was never a father to me.

57
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,479
Who was your father
close to in the village?

58
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,119
Who'd want to be close to him?

59
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,999
Everyone avoided him like the plague.

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,919
Only the wife of Xie, that simple-minded
woman, was fooled by him all day.

61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,840
Is Xie also a villager in Shipu Village?

62
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,559
By the name of Xie Hanguo.

63
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,400
He used to run an oil mill.

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,720
Is that oil mill still running?

65
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:52,239
It was shut down after he died.

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,319
He died?

67
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,799
He died long ago.

68
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,119
He got hit
crossing the highway years ago.

69
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:58,919
It happened many years ago.

70
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,200
From what you're saying,

71
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,840
Xie Hanguo's wife and Chen Daning
had an improper relationship?

72
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,520
Xie Hanguo found
that simple-minded woman somewhere.

73
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,040
She wasn't quite right up here.

74
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:16,160
It's said she didn't
even know her own name.

75
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,760
Xie Hanguo wasn't too bright either.

76
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
No idea where he found
that simple-minded woman.

77
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,840
As soon as Xie Hanguo died,

78
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,999
Chen Daning latched onto her.

79
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,879
Well, it might not be fair.

80
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,999
He was definitely tricking her

81
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,439
and after the money Xie Hanguo
saved up from his oil mill.

82
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,400
Do you know anything else
about Xie Hanguo's wife?

83
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,559
Well, she's dead too.

84
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,919
She and Xie had a son.

85
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,520
He's in his twenties now.

86
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,879
I forgot his real name.

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,520
Everyone in the village
just calls him Xie the Idiot.

88
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,720
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

89
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,520
They'll dock my pay for being out.

90
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,359
Xie Wenle,
resident of Shipu Village, 24 years old.

91
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,720
Both of his parents are deceased.

92
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,879
Regarding Xie Wenle's recent activities,

93
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,799
we've pulled his call records.

94
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:17,160
But we've found no valuable leads yet.

95
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,960
Our colleagues went to Shipu Village
to investigate.

96
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,400
Xie Wenle has been withdrawn
since childhood

97
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
and always keeps to himself.

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
He doesn't seem close to anyone.

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,999
Is there a car registered
under his name?

100
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,359
No.

101
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,080
No driver's license either.

102
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,960
About Chen Daning,

103
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,400
what did they say over in Shipu Village?

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,200
Chen Daning

105
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:43,840
was known throughout the area
as a drunk and a gambler.

106
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,200
He was lazy and shiftless.

107
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,679
He relied entirely
on his wife's farming to get by.

108
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,559
After learning of Chen Daning's affair
with Xie Wenle's mother,

109
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,720
his wife drank pesticide
and killed herself.

110
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,080
Not long after Xie Hanguo passed away,

111
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,679
Chen Daning moved in
with Xie Wenle's mother.

112
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,040
It's said he was after the money
Xie Hanguo left behind.

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,359
What was the relationship like
between Chen Daning and Xie Wenle?

114
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,720
We don't have many leads on that yet.

115
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,400
Captain Leng,
we'll verify all these details,

116
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,280
including Xie Wenle's connection
to Chen Daning,

117
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,840
Xie Wenle's biological mother,

118
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:21,359
and Xie Hanguo's financial status.

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,160
Right now, the forensic unit
is screening vehicles on the dump route.

120
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,919
But there are no results yet.

121
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:35,799
Chief Xu.

122
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,999
Should we suspend Ye Qian's duties
in the Major Crimes Unit for now?

123
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,720
I'm worried he can't handle both.

124
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,999
I trust him.

125
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:45,600
Okay.

126
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,520
Panicking won't help.

127
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,239
We have to search slowly, right?

128
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,799
Yeah.

129
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,319
Take a few days off.

130
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:00,200
Think of it as giving yourself a break.

131
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,720
Wouldn't that be nice?

132
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,040
It'll be good for your health.

133
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,720
Get yourself back in shape.

134
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,999
Then we can welcome the next chef

135
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,760
and go all out. Right?

136
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,200
Right?

137
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:29,799
Found it!

138
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:34,240
No, not a chef. It's the case.

139
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,559
I've got something here.

140
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,679
I'll hang up now.

141
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,919
Captain Leng,
we found the suspect vehicle.

142
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,040
Yes.

143
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,079
The camera captured
the suspect dumping the body.

144
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,040
But it was too far away.

145
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,696
And he wore a hat, obscuring his face.

146
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:59,120
But the license plate number was clear.

147
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,400
Yunxi BH6320.

148
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,880
Alright, I'll look up
the vehicle information.

149
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,079
The owner is Li Dong.

150
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:15,640
(Lighthouse Night Market)

151
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:27,839
Are you the owner?

152
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,439
Stop!

153
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,520
- Stop!
- Stop!

154
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,400
Stop!

155
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:50,400
What's that?

156
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,760
Move!

157
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,520
Police!

158
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:53,959
Don't run!

159
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,799
Stop!

160
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,599
Stop!

161
00:09:59,079 --> 00:09:59,839
It'll hit people.

162
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,760
That's dangerous.

163
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:10,719
Freeze! Why did you run?

164
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:11,240
Wait.

165
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,360
Officer,

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,040
my arm's about to break. Easy.

167
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,959
Take him away.

168
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,240
Easy.

169
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,400
Arrest her.

170
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,559
She drove into me.

171
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Why are you here?

172
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,640
Why can't I be here?

173
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,360
I just did a heroic act, right?

174
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,160
Instead of thanking me,
you interrogate me?

175
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:33,360
How lame.

176
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,679
That's not what I meant.

177
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,760
Come on, let's grab a drink.

178
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm still on duty.

179
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,599
Next time.

180
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:46,160
Thanks.

181
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,719
(It's too tight.)

182
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,640
(Do you know Chen Daning?)

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,679
(Who?)

184
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,919
Chen Daning from Shipu Village.

185
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,079
I don't know him.

186
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,919
This van is yours, right?

187
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,360
Yeah, it's mine.

188
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,160
Explain this.

189
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,079
Why was your van at the scene
where Chen Daning's body was dumped?

190
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,599
Body was dumped?

191
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,360
Wait. What body?

192
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:45,240
Behave.

193
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,799
Speak! Why did you kill Chen Daning?

194
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,240
I don't even know who Chen Daning was.

195
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,799
I don't know him at all.

196
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,959
I've never even heard his name before!

197
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,839
What about Xie Wenle?

198
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,679
Xie Wenle?

199
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,959
You mean Xie the idiot, right?

200
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,760
What about him?

201
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,199
He killed someone?

202
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,040
I have absolutely nothing to do
with that.

203
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm not close to him at all.

204
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,880
Then tell me what you know.

205
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,919
Well,

206
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,799
Xie the Idiot, no, Xie Wenle.

207
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,640
He lives in Shipu Village.

208
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,319
He renders cooking fat.

209
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,760
He's actually pretty good at it.

210
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,040
Our relationship is purely business.

211
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,160
I just

212
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,400
give him the pork, pig offal, lard,
and that sort of thing I collect.

213
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,799
He renders it into oil for me.

214
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,000
Each time, I leave my van with him.

215
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,439
When it's done, he calls me.

216
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,959
Then I go pick up
both the oil and the van.

217
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,959
That's all I know.

218
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,360
His place has a backyard.

219
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,559
He does all the rendering back there.

220
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,079
Captain Leng.

221
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,679
Over here.

222
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,719
I've seen this bag before.

223
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,520
It's probably been around
since his dad ran the oil mill.

224
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,679
He left it to him.

225
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,640
This is a saw.

226
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,559
I haven't seen this.

227
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,319
Well, I really haven't seen this thing.

228
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:01,799
I have no idea how he deals
with all the pork and offal.

229
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,040
I've never even been in that backyard.

230
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,000
You have no idea.

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,079
Oh my, that smell is unbearable.

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,040
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

233
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,199
It wasn't me.

234
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:03,799
Xie Wenle.

235
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,839
It wasn't me.

236
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,680
Come out.

237
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,159
Don't arrest me.

238
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,920
Don't arrest me.

239
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,319
Don't arrest me.

240
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,639
Look, I put my gun away.

241
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,480
Come out.

242
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,720
Over there.

243
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,720
Captain Leng.

244
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:50,319
Captain Leng.

245
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:51,520
Captain Leng.

246
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:52,920
Captain Leng.

247
00:18:59,359 --> 00:18:59,960
Captain Leng.

248
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,240
Captain Leng.

249
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,440
(Chen Daning's blood
was found on Li Dong's van.)

250
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,559
(We also found his DNA
on the cutting equipment)

251
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,359
(in your basement.)

252
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,200
(Why did you kill Chen Daning?)

253
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,319
What was your connection to him?

254
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,680
Why did you kill him?

255
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,720
Why dismember his body and dump it?

256
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,680
Where is Chen Daning's head?

257
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,720
Answer me, Xie Wenle.

258
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,319
Speak.

259
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,119
Little idiot.

260
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,520
Little idiot.

261
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,520
You're ignoring me, huh?

262
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,319
I am your stepdad, after all.

263
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,960
Can't even call me Dad?

264
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,680
You're just like your stupid mom.
A retard.

265
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,319
Give me some money.

266
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,960
No money.

267
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:40,960
No money?

268
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,319
30,000 yuan. Not much.

269
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,319
Really no money.

270
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:48,480
Say that again?

271
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,319
I know about that shady business
you people run.

272
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,440
No money?

273
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Who do you think you're fooling?

274
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:57,520
Get over here.

275
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,720
Come here.

276
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,879
What's with that van outside?

277
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,319
What's going on?

278
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,520
Whose van is it?

279
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,720
My friend's van.

280
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,559
Your friend's van?

281
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,760
A retard like you has a friend?

282
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,359
You have a friend?

283
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,879
It's that short guy's van, right?

284
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,159
He's been coming and going here
so many times.

285
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,639
You think I haven't seen?

286
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,599
You two are making a fortune

287
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,680
off rendering that rotten pork,
aren't you?

288
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,680
Listen up, idiot.

289
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,040
Do you know what this is?

290
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,599
It's illegal. You know that?

291
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,520
Illegal.

292
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,280
If the police find out,

293
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,839
they'll lock you in a dark cell.

294
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,000
Remember?

295
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,879
Just like when your dad
used to lock you in that dark room.

296
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:40,879
Darker than that.

297
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,000
A drooling idiot like you

298
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,920
will never get out, I'm telling you.

299
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,280
Never get out. Understand?

300
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,879
I'm telling you,

301
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:50,799
30,000 yuan.

302
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,599
Stupid idiot.

303
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,680
That short guy.

304
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,960
Do you know he's scamming you?

305
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,920
You refine all that oil
for him to sell in the city.

306
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,920
Do you know how much money that makes?

307
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,240
He's taking advantage of you, you idiot.

308
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,960
From now on, let's work together.

309
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,240
To keep the profits
in the family, right?

310
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,760
We'll talk about this later.

311
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:32,920
Just give me that 30,000 yuan now.

312
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,159
The debt collectors
are breathing down my neck.

313
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
No money.

314
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:40,680
No money?

315
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,079
Is that the only thing
you know how to say?

316
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,799
Don't make me lose my temper.

317
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,240
No money?

318
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,559
Really no money.

319
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,879
You're not giving it to me?

320
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,920
Fine, you stupid idiot.

321
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,760
Think you're all grown up now?

322
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:02,720
Alright, just you wait.

323
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,520
Tomorrow I'm going to the police
station to report you.

324
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,720
I don't believe I can't deal with you.

325
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,040
Your mother and I are legally married.

326
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,639
We have the marriage certificate.

327
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:20,399
This house and this yard.

328
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:22,920
Your mother transferred it all to me.

329
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,040
I took pity on you

330
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,680
and kindly adopted you.

331
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,920
Don't be ungrateful.

332
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,520
Just wait till the police arrest you.

333
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:47,119
You know what? I'll sell the house

334
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,000
and the yard.

335
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,879
I'll sell all this junk.

336
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
I'll make sure you never get out.

337
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,639
Just rot in there.

338
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,119
I'll sell it all.

339
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,599
N-no money.

340
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:22,799
N-no.

341
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:24,879
N-no money.

342
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,240
N-no... dark room.

343
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,639
(N-no... dark room.)

344
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,960
Dark room? What dark room?

345
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,280
Dark room.

346
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,799
Xie Wenle,

347
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,280
I don't care

348
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,000
about your reasons or concerns.

349
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,480
Since you're sitting here,

350
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,960
- just...
- No dark room.

351
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,720
No dark room.

352
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,639
No dark room.

353
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,520
(Dark room.)

354
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:56,599
(No dark room.)

355
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,520
No dark room.

356
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,680
Dark room.

357
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:01,960
Master.

358
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Send him for psychiatric evaluation.

359
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,639
His arm should be fine.

360
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,680
Do you think he might be faking it?

361
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,159
Fooling us is easy,

362
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,520
but fooling
professional psychiatrists isn't.

363
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,720
If both his parents
had some form of mental illness,

364
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,359
heredity could be a factor.

365
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,000
If that's true,

366
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,119
then his parents' marriage was invalid.

367
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:35,720
His father found some crazy woman
to marry and have a kid.

368
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,960
It was illegal to begin with.

369
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,079
Frankly, the victim
wasn't exactly a good guy either.

370
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,639
Why else would his own son disown him?

371
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,319
Xie Wenle had it tough.

372
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
But murder is illegal, no matter what.

373
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,896
(Remember to get a tetanus shot.)

374
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,799
What a mess.

375
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,440
We never thought this would happen.

376
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,904
- After Xie Hanguo died?
- Totally unexpected.

377
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,639
We didn't hear anything.

378
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,040
- We didn't hear it. We were...
- We didn't hear it.

379
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,720
Captain Leng.

380
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,440
Right over there.

381
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,480
Otherwise, I'd have called the police.

382
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
I didn't hear it. I was working.

383
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Master,

384
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,119
I've actually had a question all along.

385
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,599
A victim like Chen Daning

386
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:41,720
had a terrible reputation
and strained family ties.

387
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,119
To dispose of his body,

388
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,119
Xie Wenle could've buried it
in the mountains or in his own yard.

389
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,639
No one might've found it for years.

390
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,079
But instead, he chopped it to pieces

391
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,480
and dumped it on the highway

392
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,720
without avoiding cameras.

393
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,960
It instantly made it a major case.

394
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:00,520
That's practically
begging to get caught.

395
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,520
Too many details here don't add up.

396
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,359
But if he truly has a mental illness,

397
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,319
that will actually explain everything.

398
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:15,920
Thank you.

399
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,920
Captain Leng,

400
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,720
according to villagers
and village officials,

401
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,520
Chen Daning was confirmed
to be an alcoholic and gambler.

402
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:25,639
After Xie Hanguo's death, he started
harassing Xie Wenle's mother.

403
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,839
He also swindled away
all the savings left by Xie Hanguo

404
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,720
and blew it all.

405
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,799
After Xie Wenle's mother died,

406
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,240
he started harassing Xie Wenle
from time to time.

407
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,359
He was still after money.

408
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,720
Some people even heard him
bragging while drunk,

409
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,720
claiming he'd found a way to get rich

410
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,960
and he could seize the land
from Xie Hanguo's family.

411
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,319
What about Xie Wenle's parents?

412
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,119
Villagers only know she was found
by Xie Hanguo while he was selling oil.

413
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,119
But she did have mental issues.

414
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:58,119
She rarely spoke.

415
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,520
Sometimes she acted erratically.

416
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,639
Xie Hanguo probably feared
she'd run away,

417
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,159
so he kept her locked in a room.

418
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,240
After Xie Wenle was born,

419
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,839
he finally let her out.

420
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,559
Also, Xie Wenle was often beaten
and abused by Xie Hanguo as a child.

421
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,680
The same room in their house

422
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,559
held both Xie Wenle's mother

423
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:20,200
and, later, Xie Wenle.

424
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,240
Because Xie Hanguo thought
Xie Wenle was stupid.

425
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:25,680
Captain Leng.

426
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,000
Captain Leng,

427
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,839
we found it.

428
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,440
This room?

429
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,920
Yes, the dog alerted.
Definitely human remains here.

430
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,000
This is the dark room
Xie Wenle mentioned?

431
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,639
Right.

432
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,359
Secure the scene.

433
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,079
Wait for the forensic unit.

434
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:48,799
Yes.

435
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,200
Move out.

436
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,240
Duan, set up a perimeter.

437
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,040
Yes.

438
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:14,418
(No-Name Diner)

439
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,159
Here.

440
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:17,399
- Take care.
- Thanks.

441
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,399
- Bye.
- We're off.

442
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,319
Drinks for both of you.

443
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,440
Okay.

444
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:25,920
Have you finished studying?

445
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,399
And you're already gaming?

446
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,440
Look at Chang. He has
top grades and is still diligent.

447
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,639
Go do your homework.

448
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,599
Okay.

449
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,680
Hush now, little one.

450
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:38,480
Need anything else?

451
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,599
Sorry.

452
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,680
We haven't seen this place so lively
for a while.

453
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,799
Let me feed you. Here.

454
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:45,440
Come on.

455
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,559
Later, we'll go...

456
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,119
Enjoy.

457
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,119
But the food now

458
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,079
isn't as good as
that made by the last chef.

459
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,480
Try it.

460
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,639
Be grateful there's food.

461
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:54,960
Stop being picky.

462
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,240
How's your injury healing?

463
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:00,680
Fine now.

464
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:04,680
Be more careful next time.

465
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,839
Don't charge recklessly

466
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,319
regardless of their weapons.

467
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Have some broccoli.

468
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,399
Master.

469
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,839
Since Xie Wenle's diagnosed
with limited mental capacity,

470
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,648
regarding sentencing...

471
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,240
There's nothing more we can do.

472
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
The rest depends
on the prosecutor's office.

473
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:40,879
(No-Name Diner)

474
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:41,480
Hello?

475
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,159
Is our son asleep?

476
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,200
I just wanted to talk to him.

477
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,200
If he's asleep, don't wake him.

478
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,000
I didn't get to spend much time
with him this visit.

479
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:56,760
Okay.

480
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,960
Next time I'll make it up to him.

481
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,280
Take care of yourself too.

482
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,399
Okay.

483
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:06,960
Bye.

484
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,760
Master, I'm heading out first.

485
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:14,559
Are you free later?

486
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:15,960
Why?

487
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Let's go to...

488
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:20,680
Okay.

489
00:32:55,608 --> 00:33:00,000
(Strict Discipline)

490
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,680
Guns are our weapons against crime

491
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,399
and our last line of defense

492
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,319
in life-threatening situations.

493
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,240
This mission is exceptionally dangerous.

494
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,799
Stay safe out there.

495
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,359
Why alone? Where's your master?

496
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,839
In a meeting.

497
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,839
The Sishui River

498
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,359
sees drownings every year
from illegal swimming.

499
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,839
No amount of warning signs helps.

500
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,720
But she was wearing jeans.

501
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,279
Unlikely she came to swim.

502
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,840
What do we know?

503
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,000
The victim is a young female.

504
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,679
Based on physical development,
the estimated age is around 25.

505
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,679
Swabbing the mouth and nose

506
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,199
comes back with heavy silt.

507
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,679
I thought she was still breathing
upon entering the water,

508
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,960
meaning ante-mortem drowning.

509
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,079
But after carefully examining her body,

510
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,159
I found a fatal injury on her head.

511
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,719
It was a wound caused by violent impact.

512
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,679
Therefore, homicide is a possibility.

513
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,880
If the body was dumped after death

514
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,520
and the victim stopped breathing
before entering the water,

515
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,040
she couldn't have inhaled silt.

516
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,199
But there's one exception,

517
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,400
passive respiration in water.

518
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,480
She might have been sucked in
by a sand dredger's suction pipe,

519
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,920
and the body's chest cavity
was compressed underwater,

520
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,079
causing the victim
to passively inhale silt.

521
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,920
Ye,

522
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,520
contact our field officers
to investigate.

523
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,800
and find a sand dredger

524
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
that's been operating nearby
in the past few days.

525
00:35:15,736 --> 00:35:17,960
Sand dredging has long been banned
on the Sishui River.

526
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,759
- There are still sand dredgers?
- Yeah.

527
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,480
My dad's really into night fishing.

528
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,920
I hear him complain every day.

529
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,679
He says those dredgers rumble all night,

530
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,920
scaring all the fish away.

531
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:28,920
Doesn't maritime control handle that?

532
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,639
They do.

533
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,000
My dad and his fishing buddies
have reported them countless times.

534
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,960
But the ships now are all modified.

535
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:35,759
They're fast

536
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,840
and highly elusive.

537
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,320
It's like playing whack-a-mole.

538
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,279
I just remembered.

539
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,239
His fishing buddies

540
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,000
are more into reporting the dredgers
than into fishing.

541
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,599
They share tips daily in a group chat.

542
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,520
I'll ask my dad later

543
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,279
to see if anyone's photographed
that dredger recently.

544
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,599
Any news from your dad?

545
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,759
Not yet.

546
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:30,159
But he's asked his fishing buddies.

547
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:30,960
Any moment now.

548
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,199
What's for lunch?

549
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,719
Whatever.

550
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Whatever? Fine.

551
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:36,639
Please accept this banner.

552
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,440
We really can't accept it.

553
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,320
It's just our duty.

554
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,800
This is my small token of appreciation.

555
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,000
Please take it.

556
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,279
Solutions for the people.

557
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,279
Service with a heart.

558
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,400
That's the duty of the police.

559
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,880
We can't accept it.

560
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,719
Thank you.

561
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,000
But why won't you take it?

562
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,679
Why can't you accept the banner?

563
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,759
Is there something wrong

564
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,679
with these words?

565
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,759
No, right?

566
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:00,119
No.

567
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,079
They're facts, right?

568
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,400
If it weren't for your keen observation,

569
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,559
could the case be solved?

570
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,679
Wu Da framed me.

571
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,679
And you solved the case

572
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,599
and brought justice for Xiaole.

573
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
So I feel I should express something.

574
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,199
Please accept it, okay?

575
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,679
You're too kind.

576
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,880
Really, no need.

577
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,559
Oh my.

578
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,279
He's here to present
a commendation banner?

579
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,559
I know my spying was wrong.

580
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,759
Rest assured.

581
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,759
I will never do such a thing again.

582
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:31,400
No conscience.

583
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
Please accept this small token.

584
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:36,559
It was a joint effort
by field officers and the forensic unit.

585
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,159
Now the gratitude
only goes to you field officers?

586
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,360
Never mind.

587
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,199
We're noble
and willing to be unsung heroes.

588
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,000
Say that in front of my master.

589
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,400
Reformed ones mean good people.

590
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,639
Take it back.

591
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,639
Alright.

592
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,239
(Dan Qing)

593
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,040
Thank you.

594
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:58,400
Everyone, disperse.

595
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,199
Enjoy your meal.

596
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:04,880
Thanks.

597
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,279
This way, please.

598
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,159
Thanks.

599
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,000
You're welcome.

600
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,920
Sorry, I'm late.

601
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,800
No problem, I just got here too.

602
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,119
What's the sudden lunch about?

603
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,199
I wanted to see you.

604
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,159
It was heroic of you last time.

605
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,679
I haven't had a chance to thank you yet.

606
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Do you remember
what you said to me before?

607
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,040
What did I say?

608
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,759
You said you'd always stand
on the side of the light.

609
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,639
You still remember that?

610
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,480
Come on.

611
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,759
To you.

612
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,000
I don't drink. Thanks.

613
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:26,040
A little red wine won't get you drunk.

614
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,159
To our wonderful reunion.

615
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,520
You're looking a bit tipsy there.

616
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:26,559
Need a ride?

617
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:30,000
No, I've called a cab.

618
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,199
Alright. I'll head out first then.

619
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,360
Let's meet up again soon.

620
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,559
Can he endure this physically?
