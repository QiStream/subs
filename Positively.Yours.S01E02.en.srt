Is that my baby?

No, it's my baby.

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,067
I suppose the question was unclear.

7

I'll ask again.

Am I your baby's father?

Well... I don't know why you think that.

But it's not your baby.

So, let's just go our separate ways.

You keep being this flustered.

Given all the circumstances,
I'm certain I'm your baby's father.

You mean... you're going
to take responsibility?

Ugh, whatever.

136

Even taking responsibility
has different scenarios.

137
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,800
Option 1. Don't get married,
and just pay child support.

- What is this?
- 10 billion won.

- 10 billion?
- It's child support.

If needed, I'll add 10 million won monthly.

Don't ask to see the kid later
or say anything else.

This ending feels a bit bitter.

143
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:53,433
Option 2. I raise the baby,
and she pays me compensation.

144
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:58,267
Can I hold the baby for a moment?

No...

149

This is even worse.

150
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:26,067
Option 3. Get married
and raise the child together.

How did you know?

209
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,233
If you can't drink your favorite alcohol,
it's one of two things.

210
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:55,433
Either you're terminally ill,
or you're pregnant.

211
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,633
I had a child at twenty-two.

212
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:16,600
Back then, I was overwhelmed,
so I kept the baby without knowing better.

213
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,100
But when I think of everything
I gave up afterward,

214
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,167
- well...
- Did you regret it?

215
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,833
Well, I guess it depends on the person.

216
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:30,467
But if you're not prepared,
it can be really hard.

217
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:34,700
Even if the baby is adorable,
the child and my life are on separate paths.

218
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:38,133
It's complicated.

219

You seem troubled.
What does the baby's father say?

220

Well...

221
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,867
Sometimes, talking to
a stranger isn't so bad.

You can open up about things.

This baby wasn't planned.

224
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,767
At the most crucial moment,

225
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:09,400
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
has arrived alongside this new life.

226
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:15,933
It's something I caused,
and I know I have to take responsibility,

227
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:19,333
but I feel completely lost.

228

You don't need to feel guilty.

229

Would a child born out of regret
and unpreparedness really be happy?

329
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,633
Hold on.

330
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:17,967
Now it's not that you applied perfume,
but you practically bathed in it.

331
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:21,000
Well, as president, I have to maintain
some dignity, you know?

332
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,300
Wasn't today just a preliminary site visit?

333
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,500
Who are you trying to impress?

334
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,633
You're overdoing it. Way too much effort.

335
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,233
You, please put in some effort.

336
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,833
Why aren't you trying?
What are you relying on?

337
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,600
This is ridiculous.

338
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,967
I did put in effort. A lot of it, actually.

339
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,033
Alright.

340
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,733
From this angle, there's no issue here.

341
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,833
But here...

342
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,200
How should I put it... It's weird.

343
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,133
And it's strange and kind of bland-looking.

344
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:52,433
Hey...

345
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,652
What do you mean it's weird!

346
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:58,236
Jeez.

347
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,433
So what, is it...

348
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:06,233
'The final touch of fashion
is scent, not the face?'

349
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,533
You little punk.

350
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:28,067
- Aren't you leaving?
- I am!

351
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,167
Oh no, I got it in my mouth.

352
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:32,600
Jeez, you are such an annoying type.

353
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,933
By the way, this isn't about me.

354
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:41,900
But what's the psychology
of people who ignore texts?

355
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,967
It's simple.

356
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:45,100
First, they hate that sender.

357
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,667
Second, they absolutely despise them.

358
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,900
Third, they're insanely, maddeningly...

359
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
Hey, a fly!

360
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
- A fly!
- Whoa, hold on, I'm driving!

361
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,067
- There's a fly
- I know, I'm driving!

362
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,567
What? Someone dislikes you?

363
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,600
Have you ever seen anyone who dislikes me?

364
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,633
Oh, whatever.

365
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,033
We'll see who regrets it later.

366
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:04,067
Wow, Kang Du Jun.

367
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,633
Are you asking me for relationship advice?

368
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,200
My wife and Se Hyeon kind of complete
the anxious person I used to be.

369
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,567
I'll tell you about my love life.

370
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,867
- Back then...
- I've made up my mind.

371
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,267
About what?

372
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:19,267
I'm going to get married.

373
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,000
Huh?

374
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,567
Hey! Watch the road!

375
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,400
What... get married?

376
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,100
Hey, you said you wouldn't.

377
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,200
- I did.
- And now?

378
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,667
I'm just curious.

379
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:37,033
Thinking about it, morally
and cost-effectively...

380
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:38,500
It's better to get it over with quickly.

381
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,700
What nonsense is this? Explain it properly.

382
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,533
Did the chairman say he won't hand over
the company if you don't marry?

383
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:45,267
Or did your ideal woman suddenly appear?

384
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,833
What on earth are you thinking?

385
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,167
You won't marry because of me, right?

386
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,067
- Se Hyeon.
- You keep avoiding blind dates,

387
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:54,667
and refusing to get married.

388
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,900
I feel it's all because of me, and it hurts.

389
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,433
What is this even supposed to mean?

390
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:00,900
You... ah!

391
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,167
Is this some kind of strategic marriage
between companies?

392
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,468
Oh, I don't know.

393
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:06,533
Wait.

394
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:07,867
That might actually be better.

395
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:09,633
- Huh?
- Everyone around us

396
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:11,600
is in arranged marriages for show.

397
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,367
For us, marriage is just
another business move.

398
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,200
So why not go through with it?

399
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,600
Who knows? Maybe marriage
will fix my current instability.

400
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,833
You're seriously sick.
Let's go to the hospital.

401
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,433
Anyway, that's what you should know.

402
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:26,200
What, are you getting married by yourself?

403
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,400
Do you even have a bride?

404
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,067
I'm on my way to meet her now.

405
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,833
That bride you're so curious about...

406
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,533
Bride?

407
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,167
Are we going to church now or something?

408
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,333
No responsibility.

409
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,200
Guilty conscience.

410
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,367
A free life.

411
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:52,133
As you know, when our new president
arrives, he'll tour every floor.

412
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:54,233
Everyone, please keep things tidy.

413
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:55,967
- Environmental cleanup...
- Is she in shock from happiness?

414
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,667
She's been waiting for this moment.

415
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:58,933
Maybe the tension finally melted away.

416
00:24:58,933 --> 00:24:59,933
- Right?
- And one more thing.

417
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:00,933
Our team's business proposal...

418
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,033
Studying in Germany.

419
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:04,167
My dream coming true.

420
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:05,596
Manager Nah, take charge of this
and organize it once.

421
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:07,100
Assistant Manager Choi, support him.

422
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,533
- Yes.
- And for the remaining staff,

423
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,167
- I was so close.
- you have the performance plan, right?

424
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,800
Organize that and report it to me.

425
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,367
Tak Soo, compile it and report to me.

426
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,700
Understood.

427
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,733
And...

428
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,267
Taking responsibility.

429
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:23,633
- Single mom, lack of money.
- About the new product proposal.

430
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:24,900
It was seriously lacking. Check...

431
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,833
Workaholic.

432
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,567
A lonely child.

433
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,667
A bad mother.

434
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,767
Understood.

435
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,033
A bad mother.

436
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:43,400
- Looks like the meeting prep is mostly done.
- Alright.

437
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,233
He might start next week,

438
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:47,900
so don't let your schedules get disrupted.

439
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,000
And with Manager Jang leaving
for Germany, there's a lot to wrap up.

440
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,133
[Regular deposit]

441
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,600
This won't even come close to enough.

442
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:05,133
Manager Jang.

443
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,033
Manager Jang.

444
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:11,133
Manager Jang!

445
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,900
Are you even listening?

446
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,600
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,533
Oh, I can't drink this.

448
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:35,767
Switch with me.

449
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:38,133
This is warm milk.

450
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:46,833
Are you my aunt now?

451
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,533
Oh.

452
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:52,700
I'll keep it a secret at work. Don't worry.

453
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,200
- Um...
- My uncle

454
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,233
is not very skilled at things
outside of work.

455
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,196
Especially, when it comes to dating
and relationships.

456
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:01,084
He's kind of under-socialized.

457
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,933
Anyway, all that is just

458
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:07,500
because of his compulsion
to be perfect at everything.

459
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,167
Please look upon him favorably.

460
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,600
He says he won't get married,

461
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,800
and he acts overly conservative
about marriage,

462
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,600
but we all know that's not
how he really feels.

463
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,433
It's all because of me.

464
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:25,600
Ah.

465
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,833
So you don't know yet.

466
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:31,067
Anyway, you'll find out gradually.

467
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,233
He says he won't get married,

468
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:44,033
and he acts overly conservative
about marriage,

469
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:46,467
but we all know that's not
how he really feels.

470
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:49,033
It's all because of me.

471
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,367
What's that supposed to mean?

472
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:01,633
Why is he here?

473
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:04,300
And I told you,

474
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,767
things like who the CEO is aren't important.

475
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,267
But it's not that he's currently
managing operations,

476
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:10,267
it's about maintaining relationships.

477
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:12,533
We need to maintain those connections.

478
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:14,600
So first impressions

479
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
- are extremely important.
- Oh, no.

480
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,833
So in short,

481
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,733
for example, when passing
by employees like this,

482
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,767
you should smile and say hello,

483
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,292
but you don't smile...

484
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:24,700
Where did he go?

485
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:28,967
Du Jun!

486
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:32,567
Wait, why...

487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,900
Are you okay?

488
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,467
Why on earth are you here?

489
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,200
Did you investigate my background?

490
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,533
Did you forget we agreed
to reach a conclusion soon?

491
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:45,433
So what exactly is that conclusion?

492
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,600
I've decided.

493
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,300
I'll marry you.

494
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,567
What?

495
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,300
Are you going to keep the baby?

496
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,633
Whether you give birth or not is your choice,

497
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:05,467
but regardless of that, I also
have responsibilities for my child.

498
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:08,167
So if you're going to keep it, let's hurry.

499
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:12,100
I'd prefer the wedding be held this year.

500
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,433
Hey.

501
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:15,633
It's not hey. I'm Kang Du Jun.

502
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:17,333
Fine, Mr. Kang Du Jun.

503
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:20,833
Looks like you've been
getting way ahead of yourself,

504
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,700
but I've never once considered marrying you.

505
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,400
My own issues are complicated enough,

506
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,467
so let's just go our separate ways.

507
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,167
Let's pretend

508
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,233
this never happened.

509
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,400
You can't just erase something
that already happened.

510
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,433
What I'm saying is...

511
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,767
What's so special about marriage anyway?

512
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:42,333
Marriage is business too.

513
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,033
If you really want,
let's write up a contract.

514
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,800
Of course, with the child's care
as the top priority.

515
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:50,867
What did you say?

516
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:54,600
Then I definitely can't agree
to a marriage like that.

517
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,233
Why not?

518
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:58,067
I've already made
future plans for the child...

519
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,600
You booked that place?

520
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,433
Yes, I pulled some strings.

521
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,167
Shh.

522
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,133
What?

523
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:37,667
Team leader, this place is locked.

524
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,567
But you said you booked it for this time.

525
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,867
President.

526
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:45,700
But we were together. Where did he go?

527
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,167
Is someone inside?

528
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,900
Oh no, what do we do?

529
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,400
It seems locked from the inside.

530
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:04,567
Then to the manager's office...

531
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:07,667
What do you mean? We just go out and explain.

532
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:08,667
No way.

533
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,967
This is the perfect situation
for misunderstandings.

534
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:14,933
I'll try forcing it open.

535
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:16,867
What? You're going to force the door open?

536
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:18,300
Call quickly.

537
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,733
Then try calling me first.

538
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,156
But I don't know your number.

539
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:29,767
Alright.

540
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,167
I knew it.

541
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,633
Haven't you even saved my number?

542
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:35,228
That's not important right now.

543
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,100
You don't even read texts
from unknown numbers?

544
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,167
Should I at least be grateful
you didn't block me?

545
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,533
Okay, okay. I'm sorry about that.

546
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,867
We'll really get caught like this.

547
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:45,533
Do something.

548
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:47,500
Ah, please.

549
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,200
Three!

550
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:52,633
Ah.

551
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:53,800
- Ouch, my nose!
- What the...

552
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,708
What's going on?

553
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:58,533
President?

554
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:01,724
Ouch.

555
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,967
Ouch.

556
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,433
Oh, President, I'm so sorry.

557
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:08,867
I didn't know you were inside.

558
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:11,700
- President?
- Manager Jang, are you even listening?

559
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,333
I'm sorry.

560
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:16,733
As you know, when our new president
arrives, he'll tour every floor.

561
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,733
Everyone, please keep things tidy.

562
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:23,367
He might start next week,
so don't let your schedules get disrupted.

563
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:25,733
Then that president...

564
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:27,500
I'm Kang Du Jun.

565
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,167
But why are you here?

566
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,533
And why are you here, Manager Jang?

567
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,067
Well, I mean...

568
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:37,467
I came for a preliminary visit. But I left
my phone in the car, so I borrowed hers.

569
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:38,533
Is that a problem?

570
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,167
No, of course not.

571
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,700
If you need to finish your call,
we'll go somewhere else...

572
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,633
President!

573
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,300
Then I'll take my leave.

574
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,000
Ah, right.

575
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:02,100
Your phone works perfectly fine,
so there's no excuse for not replying.

576
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,100
Oh, and,

577
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,733
answer calls from unknown numbers too.

578
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:11,667
Let's go, Secretary Go.

579
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:13,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

580
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,267
- Well...
- Secretary Go.

581
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:26,900
Yes.

582
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,667
Then, I'll get going.

583
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:40,467
Wow.

584
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:42,333
So that's why you were
desperately looking for her?

585
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,800
And she's from the same company?

586
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,300
Did you know?

587
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,600
She's got a baby on the way,
and she wants to pretend it never happened?

588
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,660
That's ridiculous.

589
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,233
A baby? You're going to be a dad?

590
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:53,333
It's not confirmed yet.

591
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,633
What do you mean?

592
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:55,933
Seriously, tell me.

593
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,400
It's not really my decision to make.

594
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,533
I've already prepared myself mentally.

595
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:03,067
What? Explain it properly.

596
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:05,200
I've been feeling kind of betrayed lately.

597
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Ugh, seriously.

598
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,533
I misheard earlier, right?

599
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:15,033
Marriage and a baby and all that?

600
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:18,300
It's not certain yet, but you heard right.

601
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:22,433
When... when did all this even happen?

602
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:23,533
Marriage. A child.

603
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:25,100
How come it happened so fast?

604
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,033
And why didn't you tell me
about such happy news, huh?

605
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,567
I'm really hurt by this.

606
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:34,867
I'm not even sure you can call it good news.

607
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:38,733
What is it? What are you so worried about?

608
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:39,933
Why would I worry?

609
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:42,467
We've known each other for years.

610
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:46,067
That's the face you make
when you're really worried.

611
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:51,000
Think of me as your bamboo forest
and say it all.

612
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:57,660
I just know

613
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,733
it's not my decision to make.

614
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:03,100
If I were to become a real father,

615
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,500
if I were to have a baby,

616
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,500
I wonder if I could really
take proper responsibility.

617
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,033
You were right.

618
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:12,767
I guess I'm worried.

619
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:15,000
Do you remember?

620
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,800
My sister had nowhere to leave the kids.
She endured the pain until she collapsed.

621
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,733
You offered to take care of them.

622
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:25,767
Told her not to worry and go to the hospital.
It was chaos, remember?

623
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:29,200
When she got back from the hospital,
the house was a complete mess.

624
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,867
Both my nephews were hanging
off your broad back,

625
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:33,967
and they refused to come down.

626
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,533
I remember it was different
from raising Se Hyeon.

627
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:39,067
Maybe because they were boys,
their energy is unreal.

628
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:41,500
Ever since that day,
my back hurts when it rains.

629
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,000
You know what I thought watching that?

630
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,500
What? 'Kang Du Jun really can do anything.'
Something like that?

631
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,000
Yes, the Kang Du Jun I know

632
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,167
is someone who keeps his word no matter what.

633
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,133
So don't start worrying already.

634
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,600
You'll do great, okay?

635
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,500
As a dad,

636
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,200
and as a husband...

637
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:02,780
Jeez.

638
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:05,567
You're being unusually serious.

639
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:07,433
You're really putting on a whole show.

640
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,167
Ugh, just go already.

641
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,167
Well.

642
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,133
Do the dishes before you leave.

643
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:15,600
You are such an annoying type.

644
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:19,633
What? The president?

645
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:20,667
Whoa, no way.

646
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,167
Hey, isn't that a total jackpot?

647
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,600
Jackpot? What are you talking about?

648
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,167
He completely fooled me.

649
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,733
How many women must he have charmed
while hiding his identity?

650
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:31,133
Well, with that face, women
probably didn't leave him alone.

651
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,833
It's true.

652
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:36,092
But

653
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:37,933
don't you have something to tell me?

654
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:39,667
What do you mean?

655
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,367
Should I act like I know it or what?

656
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:47,833
Well...

657

Looking at your face, I guess not.

00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,967
Mi Ran, I actually got accepted
to study in Germany?

Really?

The answer is clear.

Right? That's the right choice, right?

Right, and honestly,

everything for that company?

You're still young. Go study abroad.

Do they still celebrate your birthday
at school these days?

You probably already blew out the candles.

679
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:54,633
Even the department doesn't care.
Who would celebrate a part-time lecturer?

680

Still, in the past, you used to
get cake and letters.

You take it and eat it.

Curious why I was so hated
for something that wasn't my fault.

If you regret it that much,

you shouldn't have had me.

Yes, you know it well.

You clearly said pregnancy
would be difficult then.

00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,867
Thank you.

823
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:57,600
Go.

824
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,500
Hurry.

825
00:48:01,467 --> 00:48:04,000
- I'll leave.
- Go.

826
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:22,167
Do you like that man?

827
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,900
Oh, my! You scared me!

828
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,467
But how did you find my place?

829
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:29,467
Are you two dating?

830
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:31,800
No, it's not like that.

831
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,067
I just thought you two
looked all lovey-dovey.

832
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:37,433
Seriously, we're just friends.

833
00:48:37,433 --> 00:48:39,167
Hey.

834
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,500
No, President.

835
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,633
How could you lie to me perfectly?

836
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:46,500
What exactly did I lie about?

837
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,700
Please pretend you don't know me at work.

838
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,933
Fine.

839
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:56,367
- What?
- I'll do as you wish.

840
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,233
But,

841
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:01,800
whoever your heart belongs to,
it's none of my business.

842
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,467
But I do expect us both
to take responsibility for our actions.

843
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:24,400
Does that make sense?

844
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,433

This is our new employee, Cha Min Uk.

Let's all give him a round of applause.

847

Hello, I'm Cha Min Uk
starting today in the sales team.

I look forward to working with you.

849

Your desk is over there. Go take a seat.

850
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,533
Yes.

851
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:50,780
Hello.

- Fighting!

853
00:49:57,667 --> 00:50:00,200
So how was your first day?

854
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,433
Wow, it was so hectic and nerve-wracking.

855
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,733
I didn't even know whether food
was going into my mouth or my nose.

856
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:08,733
If it weren't for the chocolate you gave me,
I would've been in big trouble.

857
00:50:08,733 --> 00:50:09,933
That stuff is expensive.

858
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:12,333
I gave it to you because it's you.

859
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:13,967
But our connection is really something.

860
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:15,800
Middle school, high school, college,

861
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,367
and now we work at the same company?

862
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:19,033
Why? I like it.

863
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:22,433
Weren't we supposed to
stick together forever?

864

- Yeah.

Wow, he has such presence.

Unbelievable.

898
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:11,933
Assistant Manager, you saw him, right?

899
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:13,267
Yeah, totally my type.

900
00:53:13,267 --> 00:53:14,600
Even as a guy, I think he's impressive.

901
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,300
The bonus was such a pleasant surprise.

902
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,633
Right? He's young but so thoughtful.

00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:21,467
And those shoulders...

904
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:24,000

you could surf on them.

Pfft, greedy much?

Whoever your heart belongs to,
it's none of my business.

Oh, dear...

Could you give me more specific plans?

First, we plan to research
each country's beer market.

930
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,000
Based on the results, we plan
to go full-scale product development phase.

where proven-quality beer

935
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,833
is packaged into cans or kegs and stored.

936
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:42,433
It seems fairly well organized.

This place is totally disorganized.
Get it sorted out quickly.

939
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:58,667
This is the brew house where we
make wort, the main beer ingredient.

940
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:02,967
Since beer production involves yeast,
please pay special attention to hygiene.

941
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:04,667
Understood.

942
00:56:07,633 --> 00:56:10,567
Oh! Wait, hold on!

943
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:23,900

00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,900
Ah, I'm going to 15...

Oh, let me carry them for you.

- I'm fine.
- With those thin wrists of yours,

948
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:49,533
what if they snap
while you're carrying those?

949
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:53,267
Give them to me.

950

It's heavy.

951
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:05,633
Yeah, what?

952
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:08,667
Are you crazy? What if you mess that up?

953
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,067
Don't even think about leaving work today.

954

- Take care.
- Then, I'll get going.

957
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,200
Huh? Wait, don't you need these?

958
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,633
You should take them with you.

959
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:40,933
For the first half of next year,
we're exploring a plan

960
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:45,400
to develop a new product by reducing
the calories of our existing Try beer.

961
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,633
We're also considering
seasonal promotional items.

962
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,267
- Did you get dragged here?
- For that,

963
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:49,633
- Lighten up a little.
- we plan to collaborate with other brands.

964
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:54,267
We'll showcase collaborative products
with various brands to customers.

965
00:57:54,267 --> 00:57:57,200
That concludes the briefing.

966
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,433
Call me if it gets hard. Even at dawn.

967
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:02,167
Got it.

968
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:12,067
Thank you for your hard work
preparing the presentation.

969
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,400
- Not at all.
- Everyone received bonuses last time, right?

970
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,300
Ah, we were extremely grateful.

971
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,333
We were all completely surprised.

972
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:22,367
Right? President, you are the best.

973
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:28,200
Then you should earn your pay.

974
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,400
I'm not saying work harder
because you got bonuses.

975
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,933
But you should at least work
to the level of your salaries.

976
00:58:33,933 --> 00:58:37,967
If there's anything lacking...

977
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,600
Everything.

978
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,500
The annual 3-year new product design report
due every September is inadequate.

979
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,933
By now, winter promotions
should be finalized as a baseline.

980
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:49,833
Next half-year's product proposals
should've been ready too.

981
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,200
Based solely on today's briefing,

982
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,767
there are zero concrete cases.

983
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,767
Since it's our first meeting together,

984
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:01,133
please provide more
detailed enhancements moving forward.

985
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:04,300
Yes, we'll fix this.

986
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,800
Ah, one more thing.

987
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,867
Is the Germany program selectee
in this New Product Development Team?

988
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:12,000
Yes.

989
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,100
Our team's Manager Jang Hui Won was chosen.

990
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,700
Ah, I see.

991
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,400
Manager Jang Hui Won.

992
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:22,867
Yes?

993
00:59:22,867 --> 00:59:25,400
Do you actually intend to go to Germany?

994
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,500
I know there are plenty of responsibilities
here requiring your attention.

995
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,633
Wouldn't it be overwhelming?

996
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,300
Jeez.

997
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,233
His personality is something else.

998
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,400
But why is he treating
Manager Jang like that?

999
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,367
Exactly. Manager Jang
really wants to go to Germany.

1000
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:49,367
Right, Manager Jang?

1001
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:57,100
You told me not to act like
I know you at work.

1002
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,467
People might misunderstand.

1003
00:59:58,467 --> 01:00:01,833
I knew you were annoying,
but this is downright shameless.

1004
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,933
Why would you ask that there?

1005
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,267
Because I'm curious.

1006
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:07,600
I have no idea what you think.

1007
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,100
Since we're on the subject, let me ask.

1008
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,700
Are you going to keep the baby?

1009
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,633
I haven't decided yet.

1010
01:00:12,633 --> 01:00:16,500
Even if I do, I won't marry you.

1011
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:21,500
You said it doesn't matter who I like.

1012
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,533
Plus, it's a waste of time discussing this
with someone who views marriage as business.

1013
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:28,000
And I'll never have a loveless marriage.

1014
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,600
Let's just stop all of this here.

1015
01:00:31,967 --> 01:00:33,233
You're bold even without alcohol.

1016
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:34,233
What did you say?

1017
01:00:34,233 --> 01:00:35,633
You said before, didn't you?

1018
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:38,367
That it's your own business
and you'll take responsibility.

1019
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:40,100
But...

1020
01:00:41,567 --> 01:00:44,000
Now that I know about it,

1021
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,567
this is my business too.

1022
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:51,467
So let's meet at least three times a week.

1023
01:00:51,467 --> 01:00:55,133
- What?
- Love. Let's give it a try properly.

1024
01:01:34,033 --> 01:01:35,867
Let's just say we both enjoyed it.

1025
01:01:35,867 --> 01:01:37,067
- Keep it cool.
- Cool?

1026
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:39,567
I let it slide that she was with another man,
and this is how she treats me?

1027
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:41,533
Either treat her well
or torment her. Pick one.

1028
01:01:41,533 --> 01:01:42,967
You're not seeking revenge, are you?

1029
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:44,900
How did you feel about
the father of Hui Won's child?

1030
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,767
Are you here to ask about that now?

1031
01:01:46,767 --> 01:01:48,167
Then what about taking it slow?

1032
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:49,200
I don't want to stop.

1033
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,267
The secret woman,
Kang Du Jun's illegitimate child.

1034
01:01:51,267 --> 01:01:52,967
We just need to frame it, right?

1035
01:01:52,967 --> 01:01:57,398
Because of you, our entire team
is about to be investigated.

1036
01:01:57,398 --> 01:01:58,833
Ow.

1037
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:01,500
President, we've got a serious problem.
