00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,100
- Why? What?
- Oh my.

165
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,433
- What are you touching right now?
- Oh, hey.

166
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:43,867
Every guy who tried flirting
with you eventually gave up.

167
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:47,267
That's because they tried
to rush things way too fast.

168
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,657
Hui Won, you need to
drop that old-fashioned idea

169
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:51,000
that you must 'take it slow'

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
when seeing someone.

171
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,233
If the vibe's right,

172
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,092
you can get everything done

173
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:57,733
in half a day.

174
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,900
Hey.

175
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,167
You're only against marriage,
not dating, right?

176
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,067
Of course, I'll date.

177
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,733
I even have someone I like.

178
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,700
Oh you? Who?

179
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,900
There is. Don't be surprised later
when you see how handsome he is.

180
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,600
Alrighty then, okay.

181
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,500
Drink up. Let's drink ourselves
to death tonight.

182
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,633
Hey, you're paying for everything
here tonight, okay?

183
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,233
Cheers!

184
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,188
Ah, this is so funny.

185
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:25,700
Oh.

186
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,600
I had such a rough day today, seriously.

187
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:33,933
Sir, give me a bottle of Try...

188
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,800
No, no, make it two bottles, please.

189
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,033
Cheers.

190

- You're going down tonight.
- I'm gonna beat you today.

191
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
- No sipping!
- I finished it all.

192
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:54,800
Sad?

193
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:56,967
Huh? I'm not drunk.

194
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,067
- You know, I'm usually super cool, right?
- It's not that, seriously.

195
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:01,233
- Three, six, nine. Three, six, nine!
- Bang!

196
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,000
Drunk?

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,967
Wake up. Time for round two.

198
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:12,700
Sir, another bottle of Try here, please.

199
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,233
So then, he suddenly disappeared?

200
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,400
Got it for now.

201
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,100
Oh, my head...

202
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,700
See?

203
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,767
I told you I should go keep an eye on him.

204
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:34,767
You know that blind date the other day?

205
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:38,500
He set Chae Yeon's childhood pictures
as his phone wallpaper

206
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,133
and even pretended to be her father.

207
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,300
Oh, my head...

208
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,433
I had to explain that mess...

209
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:49,367
He's that desperate not to get married,
so let's give him some time.

210
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,033
You calm down too.
Jeong Eum will be here soon.

211
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,900
How could I possibly calm down?

212
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,400
Do you think I don't know

213
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,733
how the board's been itching to tear

214
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,867
Du Jun apart ever since your sabbatical?

215
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,033
- I'll try to handle that...
- Oh, dear.

216
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,767
How exactly?

217
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:08,700
Like last time, when everything blew up,
and you only showed up to clean the mess?

218
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,933
He's not acting this way for no reason.

219
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:15,233
It's that pointless
sense of responsibility of his.

220
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,833
From what I see, Jeong Eum must be

221
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,567
pressuring Du Jun somehow...

222
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,333
Pressuring him how?

223
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,067
Oh? You're here.

224
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,033
Sit here.

225
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,067
Se Hyeon has plans?

226
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,067
Yes.

227
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,433
Oh.

228
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,233
Let's continue the conversation
you two were having.

229
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,028
I love talking about myself.

230
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,871
Oh.

231
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,400
Well, since Du Jun

232
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,900
keeps avoiding blind dates
and refuses to get married...

233
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,733
Is marriage really necessary?

234
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:50,767
It's not like marriage guarantees
you won't end up alone.

235
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:52,500
Just like me.

236
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,033
Excuse me for a moment.

Yeah, I'm with my in-laws.

Has that punk lost his mind?

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,367
Tell him to get out.

241
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,467
Show him what happens
when he stabs me in the back.

242
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:25,800
Sorry, it's work-related.

243
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,733
Oh, yes.

244
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,067
It's okay.

245
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,633
But seriously, why don't you
want to get married?

246
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:05,967
I can't.

247
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,267
I said I can't do it.

248
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,231
No! No!

249
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:17,833

the youngest manager for nothing.

254
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,867
What, did she even brag about proving it?

255

is obviously Manager Jang's.

Guess you haven't heard, Se Hyeon.

Every three years, the company
picks top-performing employees

But competition's insane these days,

so rumor is they're even
scoring creativity now.

262

Still, who could possibly beat Manager Jang?

I've never seen anyone so relentless
in new product development.

She heard minerals were
used in medicine and cosmetics

265
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,500
and went mining for ones
that could work in beer.

266
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,300
That's not all. She planned
limited-edition beer with rare fruit

267
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
and went trekking through jungles.

268

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,533
You went around calling me
Tarzan again, didn't you?

273
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:48,567
Because of you, there are all
these weird rumors going around.

Did I say anything that wasn't true?

- Got any brilliant ideas?

come up with fresh, creative ideas,

You must've learned something in a month.

Didn't your supervisor teach you anything?

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,700
Just scold me already.

294
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,400

You think you can just sit back
now that Germany's basically a done deal?

299
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:48,567
I suppose that's smarter than getting
involved and docking your own score.

300
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,967
So, I just need to bring it

00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:07,600
I worked all weekend because of her,
and now she's messing with my junior.

304
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,833
Why's she always obsessed
with taking me down?

305
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,933
Because a junior who's better
than her keeps threatening her turf.

306
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:16,800
She blames you for last year's
failed promotion, right?

307
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,167
No, that was

308

because she tried to claim
our team's all-nighter as her work.

00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:46,233
I thought maybe you'd finally
started thinking about marriage.

326
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:48,167
You know how my parents are.

327
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,167
Get out! Get out!

328
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,667
Why should I leave? This is my house!

329
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,833
Since when?

330
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,067
How could you do this to us?

331
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,900
Dad, Dad!

332
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,067
Dad, please don't go.

333
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:03,100
Dad, please don't go.

334
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,467
Dad.

335
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:07,800
Dad.

336
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Huh?

337
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,033
You still think your parents' divorce
was your fault?

338
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:16,100
So, why would anyone marry without love?

339
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,733
Even if it hadn't been Dad's affair,
they would've divorced anyway.

340
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,700
They weren't compatible.

341
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,300
When well-matched people meet,
they might go a lifetime without fighting.

342
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,400
Then, you...

343
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,467
Even if you meet someone
you truly love later, you won't marry?

344
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:31,467
Huh?

345
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:32,533
Never mind.

346
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:36,333
Why am I asking so much
to someone who prioritizes work?

347
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,433
I should go. The team leader called for me.

348
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:47,200
Ah, what? You said you'd help me
figure out the beer issue.

349
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:50,600
Don't overthink it.

350
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,867
Being overly cautious can be poison.

351
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:56,900
The path lies where you seek the answer.

352
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,600
Beer problems get solved at a pub.

353
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,033
I'll get going.

354
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:03,233
Hey.

355
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,933
I really have to go.

356
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,733
I became more careful because of you...

357
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:24,508
Oh.

358
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,644
What brings you here?

359
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:29,200
Hey.

360
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,367
Say hello to him.

361
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,533
This is Manager Song, a good friend of mine.

362
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:36,433
Pleased to meet you. I'm Manager Song.

363
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:44,188
Apologies, but I need to step out.
Please get straight to the point.

364
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:45,596
Huh?

365
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:48,833
Oh.

366
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:53,333
You remember the commercial
building project I mentioned before?

367
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,133
I was thinking of doing that
together with Manager Song.

368
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:57,800
I believe I addressed that last time.

369
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,300
There's already a qualified person for that.

370
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,633
More importantly, Q2 operating profits
for the resort business hit a historic low.

371
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,067
With your approval, Vice Chairman,
I'll reassign the lead.

372
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,300
Are you saying you'll fire Team Leader Park?

373
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,033
More like relocating the team
to a suitable position.

374
00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:14,733
No, but still...

375
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:18,500
Team Leader Park has handled
the resort project since the beginning...

376
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,933
Compensation is repaid with results.

377
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,400
Not loyalty or diligence.

378
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,633
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

379
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,367
I have a meeting.

380
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,667
That insolent little...

381
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:44,733
That's right, that's right.

382
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,633
Oh, yeah.

383
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:50,933
Oh, you're here.

384
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,133
Doing this at the office too?

385
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,433
Wrong question.

386
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,267
I can only do this at work.

387
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,667
Your mom would smack my back if she saw this.

388
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,333
That's right, that's right.

389
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,000
Mom's still really mad, huh?

390
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,667
She's always been like that.

391

[Finish]
That's right, yay!

[Mari]
I came in first place.

393
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:10,600
This game's great for relieving stress.

Still busy these days?

395
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:17,200
Rumor has it you're working like a warrior.

396
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,700
I'm just doing what needs to be done.

397
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,500
That gesture with your hand...

398
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,300
Never mind.

399
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,233
Ah, Du Jun, first you need
recognition from the board.

400
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:36,567
It seems Moo Young is trying
to shake up the board with this issue.

401
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,833
Now, hand over
the trading company affairs to me.

402
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,433
- Father.
- Instead, from now on,

403
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:43,200

00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:47,100
As president, not managing director.

405

With spicy greasy food, lagers
completely lose their flavor and aroma.

406
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,700
'You're better off with something aromatic.'

407
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,867
'Stout works well, IPA's fine too.'

408
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,367
I want to tell them that.

409
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,267
But I should hold back, right?

410
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,100
Do you know him?

411
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,667
Huh? No, nothing.

412
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,667
Boyfriend?

413
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,267
Ugh, your face turned bright red.

414
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,433
He's a bit older, but a total romantic.

415
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:24,533
Though whether it's 3 months or 30 years,
we'll have to live together to find out.

416
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,500
Live together?

417
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,267
Cohabitation. I firmly believe in
living together before marriage.

418
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:31,700
Well, true.

419
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,133
Breaking up is better than getting divorced.

420
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,367
You have a boyfriend, right, Manager?

421
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,767
Someone this perfect
can't possibly be single.

422

I've decided that I must
study in Germany next.

655

I've decided to create my own beer
that will captivate foreigners' taste buds.

656
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:46,433
That's my dream.

657
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:50,800
You like drinking, have a lot you want to do,

658
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,967
and are full of passion.

659
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:57,967
I'm passionate, but I lack courage,
so I guess I borrow strength from alcohol.

660
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:01,233
What about you? What's your dream?

661
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:03,267
I don't have anything like that.

664
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,967
Just handling my responsibilities
is overwhelming enough.

You live so rigidly.

666

Are you a perfectionist, something like that?

667
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,267
Well, I guess if a person ever loosens up,
all that happens is mistakes.

How does a person like that

Did you know?

672
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:32,033
Some of the most beloved beers in history

673

were created by accident or mistake.

This lager

675
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:42,000
was created by accident
when beer was aged in a cold cave.

676
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,167
If you live too intensely,

677
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:47,600
you can easily miss
the unexpected moments that come along.

678

What's so great about having a dream?

679
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,800
Being composed in the face
of mistakes is also a dream.

680

I'm having indigestion

[5 Years Ago]
It is indeed an endometrial cyst.

833
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,433
Moreover, your uterus is congenitally weak,

834
00:59:42,433 --> 00:59:45,667
so pregnancy might be difficult.

might be difficult for me.

No, I know who he is.

Today, we checked
the gestational sac and yolk sac.
