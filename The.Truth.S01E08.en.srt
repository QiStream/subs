=Episode 8=

3
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,720
Can we extract DNA?

4
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,361
Waiting for the results.

5
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:28,600
If we can confirm
these hairs belong to the victim,

6
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,720
then the owner of these clothes
is the real killer.

7
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,681
You're staying here all night,

8
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:44,880
leaving your dad alone?

9
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,880
Ms. Wang's with him.

10
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,521
Have you eaten?

11
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,961
Bread's over there.

12
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,760
Have some.

13
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,841
Otherwise, your stomach will hurt.

14
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,720
I ate.

15
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,200
I'll go to Jiao.

16
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:19,920
Any new clues?

17
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:20,920
Master.

18
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,081
Sit.

19
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:25,160
Judging from this video,

20
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,920
these two individuals have
very similar builds and clothing.

21
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,241
The bag he's carrying

22
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:33,681
is basically identical to the one
we fished out of the lake.

23
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,640
So we can conclude
they're the same person.

24
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:40,521
If they're the same person,

25
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:45,121
then this person exited the south gate
of the community at 1:05 AM,

26
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,681
and reached the pond by 1:15 AM.

27
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,640
That's several kilometers away.

28
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,361
He was quite quick.

29
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,440
After dumping the bag,

30
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
where did he go?

31
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:03,960
(South gate, Pond)

32
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,801
Qian.

33
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:35,736
(Yumo, long time no see)

34
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:51,352
(Dan Qing, long time no see)

35
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:14,776
(Dan Qing, long time no see.
Available this weekend?)

36
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,481
He took the bait already?

37
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:22,561
Seems he still can't forget you.

38
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:23,640
Right?

39
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
Bao Hei will definitely
send people to watch.

40
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:32,561
Let's hope your ex-boyfriend is smart.

41
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,241
I don't care.

42
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,921
As long as he takes the bait,

43
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,241
he can't escape.

44
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:51,400
(Yunxi Police Department)

45
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,721
The blood

46
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,921
(Hauled up: Sports jacket, scalpel, etc.)
on the gloves and on the scalpel

47
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,520
are confirmed to belong
to the victim, Wang Xiaole.

48
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,520
On the sports jacket,

49
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,760
I detected two different DNAs.

50
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,840
One belongs to the victim Wang Xiaole,

51
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,561
the other is from an unknown male.

52
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,921
I found some hairs
on the zipper of the sports jacket.

53
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,721
Testing confirmed they also
belong to the victim Wang Xiaole.

54
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,400
Based on the location, I speculate

55
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,440
when the killer

56
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,840
(Hauled up: Key, rubber gloves, etc.)
grabbed Wang Xiaole's hair,

57
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,001
he tore it out during repeated impacts.

58
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,681
So we can be fairly certain
this unknown male is the killer.

59
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,681
Can we find this person using the DNA?

60
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:30,880
I've already uploaded the data.

61
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,520
If this person has a previous record
in our system,

62
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,760
then we'll find him quickly.

63
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,161
But if not,

64
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,200
then I can only run a comparison
after we apprehend a suspect.

65
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,080
But we can confirm it's not Wu Da.

66
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:46,320
This key appears to be a duplicate.

67
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,041
Does it open
the victim's apartment door?

68
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,280
We've tried, Captain Leng.

69
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,960
It does open.

70
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,760
That bag looks like the giveaway
for signing up for a gym membership.

71
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:55,481
If there's a brand on the bag,

72
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,960
we could trace it.

73
00:06:57,161 --> 00:06:59,561
That gym went out of business years ago.

74
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,921
Long, go sleep in my room.

75
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:14,320
No prints on that thing.

76
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,041
He wore gloves.

77
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,721
Young people can sleep soundly.
I really envy him.

78
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,880
I have some findings on the video.

79
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:28,152
(Dongyuan, Alley 07)

80
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:30,808
But it can't be enlarged any further.
This is the best it gets.

81
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:35,161
Now we know the person is
in medium build, on the thin side.

82
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,041
Estimated height
between 1.75m and 1.80m.

83
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,280
He was heading towards Dongyuan.

84
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:44,880
Dongyuan is an urban village.

85
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:48,001
The permanent population
might be at least 3,000.

86
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:48,640
Oh, no.

87
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:50,361
That's just permanent population.

88
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,481
Including migrant population,
it would be more.

89
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:53,320
That's much more.

90
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,921
The roads and terrain
in Dongyuan are complex.

91
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,080
There are only about
seven or eight cameras total.

92
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
Too many blind spots.

93
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,921
If he is a resident of Dongyuan,
that would be manageable.

94
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,440
If he just passed through

95
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,681
Dongyuan or hid there
briefly before leaving,

96
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,001
that makes it tricky.

97
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,121
I'll say something.

98
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,440
We currently know the suspect

99
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,128
had been peeking at the victim
for years from the pine woods

100
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,208
behind Shancheng Community.

101
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,921
That shows he's quite familiar
with the surrounding terrain.

102
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,280
West of Shancheng Community,

103
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,561
less than 500 meters away

104
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,840
(Map)
is the Ring Road.

105
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,880
The traffic there is very convenient.

106
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,961
He could discard the clothes
along the way.

107
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:38,104
The suspect left Shancheng Community

108
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,880
after the crime
without drawing attention.

109
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:43,520
So I don't think he would
deliberately take a detour

110
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,481
to Dongyuan in the opposite direction.

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,400
That'd also increase the risk
of being spotted and noticed.

112
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:58,920
I think even if the suspect isn't
a permanent resident of Dongyuan,

113
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,800
he at least frequents this area.

114
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,481
Captain Leng, I think

115
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:08,481
if we take action
in the Dongyuan jurisdiction now,

116
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,760
we might alert the suspect
and he might flee?

117
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:16,640
Our operation to dredge the sewage pond
was quite a scene.

118
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:20,560
If the suspect was watching
from the shadows,

119
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,241
he must have alerted by now.

120
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:28,520
Otherwise, to be safe,

121
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,576
we'll first coordinate with
the community security unit,

122
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:34,400
and conduct a sweep under the pretext
of preventing robbery and theft.

123
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,880
Start with the permanent residents.

124
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,560
You, Wang Tong.

125
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,121
Here!

126
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:39,680
Liu Yang.

127
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,081
Here!

128
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,296
Based on the social circles
of Wu Da and Wang Xiaole,

129
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,241
you conduct an investigation

130
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,280
to see if anyone has connections
to the Dongyuan area.

131
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,280
Action! Hurry!

132
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,760
- Yes!
- Yes!

133
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,920
This is the Dongyuan urban village.

134
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,241
Let's go take a look.

135
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:07,760
Alright.

136
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,201
This way.

137
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,040
Who's the owner?

138
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,800
Me! I'm the owner.

139
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,201
Ask you something.

140
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,361
We're from CID.

141
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:21,880
Okay.

142
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:26,481
Ma'am.

143
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,560
Yes?

144
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,280
Ask you something.

145
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,361
What is it?

146
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,201
Are your customers all regulars?

147
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:33,640
- Any unfamiliar faces?
- Yes.

148
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,361
All residents from nearby.

149
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,121
All residents?

150
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,760
Yes.

151
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,520
No strangers?

152
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:38,121
No.

153
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,081
Just ahead.

154
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:42,121
Thank you.

155
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,081
Okay, no problem.

156
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:51,880
This one's ready.

157
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:52,640
Hurry.

158
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,361
Okay. Come on.

159
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,441
Have one.

160
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,241
I'm not hungry.

161
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,040
Take it easy.

162
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,224
How long have you been a policeman?

163
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,241
Four years.

164
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:10,880
Four years?

165
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,401
Well, I...

166
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:16,920
I became a policeman at twenty.

167
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,441
I'll be retiring soon.

168
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,400
I wanted to go all out
on this Shancheng case.

169
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,721
But I'm old now, not capable as before.

170
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,841
Can't keep up
with you young folks anymore.

171
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,520
What flavor?

172
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,160
Ms. Wang.

173
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,680
You're back.

174
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:00,481
Dinner's kept warm for you.

175
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,721
Go wash your hands and eat.

176
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:04,040
Dad.

177
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,441
Leng.

178
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:18,280
I won't wash these dishes
of yours today, okay?

179
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,361
Well, you got off work early.

180
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:22,441
I want to go back early today.

181
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,201
My daughter brought the kids over

182
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:27,361
and they're staying
at my place for a few days.

183
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,520
Alright. Thank you.

184
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,321
Leng, well...

185
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,920
I've worked for you
for years now, right?

186
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:39,680
Well, we know each other pretty well.

187
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,640
You know how expensive
everything is nowadays.

188
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,201
I have elderly and kids to support.

189
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:49,321
- I need to...
- Ms. Wang.

190
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,441
Ms. Wang, I understand.

191
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,040
My dad can't be left alone.

192
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,680
Well, I'll give you
an extra 800 yuan a month.

193
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
What do you think?

194
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,241
That's too much.

195
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:02,800
Thank you.

196
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,121
My job is really demanding.

197
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,160
You really helped me a lot.

198
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:08,601
No problem.

199
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,841
Then it's settled.

200
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:10,441
Okay.

201
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,601
I-I'm leaving then.

202
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:12,721
Alright. Take care.

203
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,081
I saw it online.

204
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,241
Didn't expect
he's running an art gallery now.

205
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:33,624
(Phone password)

206
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,121
Okay, see you then.

207
00:15:10,121 --> 00:15:10,920
Who's it?

208
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:12,961
Who are you meeting then?

209
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:14,361
None of your business.

210
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,160
Is it your unrequited love?

211
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,601
How's it going? Tell me.

212
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,800
You're wearing this tomorrow?

213
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:29,001
What's wrong?

214
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:32,961
It's nice. Suits you.

215
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:39,880
Good taste.

216
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,760
Master.

217
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,361
New info from the medical school.

218
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,201
They found the guy who got into
a fight with Wu Da during school.

219
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:05,800
He is Niu Bosheng,

220
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,321
male, 34 years old,

221
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:08,001
a local.

222
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,841
Ph.D. in Clinical Medicine
from Yunxi Medical University.

223
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:14,760
They were in the same year at college,
but in different classes.

224
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,241
He attended the same middle school
and high school as Wang Xiaole.

225
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,280
He joined the mountaineering club
in college.

226
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:24,152
After graduation, he worked
in General Surgery at Central Hospital.

227
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:26,441
Under the counterpart support policy,

228
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:30,201
he holds clinic hours every Wednesday
at Dongyuan Community Health Center.

229
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:33,640
Wu Da got into a physical fight
with him during school.

230
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,081
They got a demerit for it.

231
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,721
So why did they fight?

232
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,841
Wu Da accused Niu Bosheng
of peeking and harassing Wang Xiaole.

233
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:56,472
(Yunxi Central Hospital)

234
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
You did it on purpose?

235
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:01,040
Didn't we agree not to wear it together?

236
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,001
I swear on my life, man.

237
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,360
I was sleeping when you got up.

238
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,881
How did I know you'd wear this?

239
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:07,961
If you can't stand it,

240
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,520
there's a clothing store.

241
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,481
Go buy a new one.

242
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Why don't you buy one?

243
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,040
First, this isn't my fault.

244
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,441
You should've told me last night.

245
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,320
Second, I'm broke.

246
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:25,080
It's field work today.

247
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:26,520
Why are you coming along?

248
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,641
Your master said

249
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
that person is basically
a high-IQ criminal.

250
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,721
You might need help, so he sent me.

251
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Don't reveal who we are at first.
Just talk to him.

252
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,560
See how he reacts.

253
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:40,360
Of course. Let's go.

254
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:45,560
That's it?

255
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,641
Yes. Enter the info and hit submit.

256
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,600
That's it.

257
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,481
Okay, thanks.

258
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:49,961
No problem.

259
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:53,201
Registered.

260
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,161
You! Stay away from me!

261
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,681
Where can I go? It's crowded here.

262
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,201
I wish to stay away from you.

263
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:18,201
Way too crowded.

264
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,560
All hospitals are like this, crowded.

265
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:24,800
Definitely.

266
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:30,080
(Patient 047, Si Yuanlong,
please proceed to Room 1.)

267
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:32,201
Let's go.

268
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:39,201
Which one of you is the patient?

269
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,641
Me. He's just here with me.

270
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:47,241
A grown man needs company
to see the doctor?

271
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,520
I'm emotionally fragile.

272
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:50,600
What's the problem?

273
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:54,120
My hand hurts.

274
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:59,001
The wound's healing okay.

275
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,080
Scar tissue doesn't look hypertrophic.

276
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,641
How did this happen?

277
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,008
Well...

278
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:07,921
It...

279
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,201
He got drunk and rowdy with me.

280
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,201
He even pulled a knife

281
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:13,520
and said I stole his girlfriend.

282
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,641
Tell me, is he crazy?

283
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:15,760
Listen up!

284
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,201
I want all of it covered,

285
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:19,080
the medical bills,
the trauma, everything!

286
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:21,401
Why should I pay? Not a chance!

287
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,681
You kept texting my girlfriend,

288
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:25,520
like a ghost haunting me.

289
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,080
Yet you want me to pay your bills?

290
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,881
Wanting a beating?

291
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,481
Me? You're insane!

292
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,961
You always pester her.

293
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:33,961
It's one-sided love. You know?

294
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:35,360
Your girlfriend? You...

295
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,960
You...

296
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,881
You two, go out if you want to quarrel.

297
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:41,721
This is a hospital.

298
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,881
I'll prescribe you
erythromycin ointment.

299
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:48,120
Apply it for several days.

300
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:50,641
Okay.

301
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:51,241
Alright.

302
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Anything else?

303
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,320
What's going on?

304
00:19:58,641 --> 00:19:59,600
Sorry, Doctor.

305
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:07,881
Sorry.

306
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:09,320
I'm really sorry.

307
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:30,320
W-Wear the mask.

308
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,800
Okay. Thank you.

309
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,001
We'll go get the medicine.

310
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:34,721
Go get it.

311
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:35,840
Thank you.

312
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,641
Hello.

313
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:48,001
Captain Leng, we have the results.

314
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:50,881
It matches the male DNA
on that sports jacket.

315
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:53,921
Thank you for your hard work.

316
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:56,441
Tell the forensic unit staff
to get off work early.

317
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:57,401
Okay.

318
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,241
Confirmed.

319
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:57,880
(Longyan)

320
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:04,080
- Good!
- Impressive!

321
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:07,600
Little Qian,
your cooking skills are amazing.

322
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,840
Why not consider being my partner?

323
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,441
You're wrong.

324
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:13,721
Little Qian is the star
of our police force,

325
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:15,760
Captain Leng's prized student.

326
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,481
He'll become unit chief,
deputy chief, then chief someday.

327
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,481
Then off to the province, the ministry.

328
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Your small place can't satisfy him.

329
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,120
But it can satisfy me.

330
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,040
You? What can you do?

331
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,600
I can be the fortune cat.

332
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,481
I'm serious.

333
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,840
Quit being a policeman.

334
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,721
It's exhausting and pays poorly.

335
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,921
Think about it.

336
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,520
You won't run off
early again today, right?

337
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,681
No, we definitely won't run off today.

338
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,881
What made you decide to cook here today?

339
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,600
I promised him this before.

340
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:12,201
Si Yuanlong.

341
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:15,881
You like me?

342
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:18,921
Y-Yes.

343
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:21,280
Haven't I told you
s-several times before?

344
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:23,201
It's real, not a joke.

345
00:24:23,401 --> 00:24:24,881
Do you still want to be my friend?

346
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:28,201
I really enjoy being friends with you.

347
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,120
But I don't like you as my boyfriend.

348
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:33,481
And you, Ye Qian.

349
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:35,080
I'm telling you. It's unnecessary.

350
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:38,201
It's my business that I like you.

351
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,360
You don't have to like me,
but don't set me up with anyone.

352
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,120
What do you mean?

353
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,641
Do you look down on me or on him?

354
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:52,001
I'm not worth your time.

355
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,721
I'm sorry.

356
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,080
Wait. Are you really leaving?

357
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,641
You're just letting him leave?

358
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Leave if you want.

359
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,001
I won't leave.

360
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,441
I'll stay with you.

361
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:27,600
Sorry.

362
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,800
I was a bit harsh just now.

363
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:31,040
Don't mind it.

364
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,721
It's fine.

365
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:33,800
I'm glad that you see me

366
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,320
as a friend. Really.

367
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:37,280
And I don't have many merits,

368
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:39,201
but I'm definitely thick-skinned.

369
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,001
Did he get any news
about Chen Yumo recently?

370
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:52,280
W-Why would you say that?

371
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,080
He's been in a good mood lately.

372
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:56,080
He never apologizes to me
if he's in a bad mood.

373
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,241
Well, he does have an appointment later.

374
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:06,921
Probably with his unrequited love.

375
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,241
But I don't know the details.

376
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:11,721
I just overheard them
chatting on WeChat.

377
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,120
Do you know where they're going?

378
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,641
To a place called Niu something...

379
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,481
Probably a gallery run
by one of your friends?

380
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:20,881
Come on. Let's go see the show.

381
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,641
It's inappropriate.

382
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:25,120
Coming or not?

383
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,080
If not, I'll go alone.

384
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:28,040
Yes.

385
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:29,401
If you go, I'll go.

386
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,360
Name.

387
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,401
Niu Bosheng.

388
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,921
Niu Bosheng.

389
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,201
Do you know why you're here?

390
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:44,921
Xiaole is dead.

391
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:47,520
You would definitely find me.

392
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,080
Tell us.

393
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,800
What did you do to Wang Xiaole?

394
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:02,161
I set up a telescope in the woods

395
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:04,641
north of her community.

396
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,681
You call that peeping.

397
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,040
So why were you peeping at Wang Xiaole?

398
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,401
I love her.

399
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,280
That's all?

400
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,600
That's all.

401
00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:45,848
(Modern Art Exhibition)

402
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:56,080
Little Qian looks quite decent now.

403
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,921
Why doesn't he just put on makeup?

404
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:02,320
This is almost like wearing makeup.

405
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:08,681
Right. About that thing, don't...

406
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,201
Let's not mention that.

407
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,241
Okay.

408
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:14,721
Besides, we don't suit.

409
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,001
From family background
to interests to careers.

410
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,441
And you're a policeman.

411
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,320
If I weren't a policeman,

412
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,280
would I have a chance?

413
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,800
I'm joking. Don't be so shocked.

414
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,481
I know we're not from the same world.

415
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
Why did you become a policeman?

416
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,280
I talked about this
with Little Qian before.

417
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,850
My parents

418
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:56,520
always hoped I'd find an easier job.

419
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,280
But being a policeman
is anything but easy.

420
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,320
It's really exhausting,

421
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,560
with no fixed holidays

422
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:05,201
or high pay.

423
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:06,481
Just look how broke I am.

424
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:10,800
But later, I thought it over.

425
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:14,424
Becoming a policeman
is absolutely the best choice

426
00:29:14,424 --> 00:29:16,312
I've made in over 20 years.

427
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:19,800
The sense of achievement

428
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,881
from cracking a case

429
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:24,721
with some clues

430
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,641
is something no amount
of money can ever buy.

431
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:44,191
Get him to talk about

432
00:29:44,191 --> 00:29:46,800
that fight with Wu Da
in med school that got him demerits.

433
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,001
Talk.

434
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,961
That's because Wu Da
caught me peeking at Xiaole.

435
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,040
He even suspected
I had an affair with Xiaole.

436
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,921
Then we got into a fight.

437
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:06,800
But at least that day,

438
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,520
Xiaole finally knew about me.

439
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,120
Honestly, I never meant
to disrupt their lives.

440
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,320
I just wanted to watch over her quietly.

441
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:23,320
At first, Wu Da seemed like
a decent boyfriend.

442
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,641
He treated Xiaole well,

443
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,441
and seemed faithful.

444
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,961
But he just couldn't make it big.

445
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,600
He couldn't even hold a scalpel steady,

446
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,520
so he couldn't become a doctor.

447
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,320
Seeing all those pharmaceutical reps
making big money,

448
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:43,641
he can barely scrape by.

449
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
But poor Xiaole suffered,

450
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:49,600
living in such a remote place.

451
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,560
Actually, he didn't buy
that second-hand apartment himself.

452
00:30:59,001 --> 00:30:59,961
(Wedding of Wu Da and Wang Xiaole)
Is this the place?

453
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,201
Welcome!

454
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:02,800
Congrats!

455
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,704
- Happy wedding!
- Happy wedding!

456
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:04,560
Come on in.

457
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,161
Okay.

458
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,280
Did Wu Da borrow money from you?

459
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,721
Yes.

460
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:23,080
He asked every classmate
from high school.

461
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,840
Did you lend him?

462
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
It was a huge amount.

463
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,881
How could I possibly lend him?

464
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,201
Besides,

465
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,360
he even needs to borrow money

466
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,001
to buy that second-hand apartment
in Shancheng Community.

467
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:35,560
He's really hit rock bottom.

468
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,840
He asked me
and I didn't know what to do.

469
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,481
You know?

470
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,080
Don't lend him.

471
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,681
Why would Wu Da even invite you
to his wedding with Wang Xiaole?

472
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,201
Wouldn't it be awkward
seeing each other?

473
00:31:56,961 --> 00:32:01,320
Their wedding was just Wu Da's scheme
to rake in cash gifts.

474
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,681
He sent invitations to everyone,
friends or strangers.

475
00:32:05,481 --> 00:32:06,881
Lots of people showed up.

476
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:09,201
Actually, we didn't even greet.

477
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,360
But I loved Xiaole.

478
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,280
I can't stand seeing
Xiaole suffer like this.

479
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:16,681
I took out 200,000 yuan myself.

480
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,800
I got a classmate to lend it
to Wu Da in his name.

481
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,161
Then what?

482
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:24,984
You asked the hospital leadership

483
00:32:25,688 --> 00:32:30,080
to take on the task at the Dongyuan
Community Health Center, right?

484
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:34,001
Just to get closer
to Wang Xiaole, right?

485
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:36,520
Right?

486
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,921
Right.

487
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:42,760
I didn't want to be too far from Xiaole.

488
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:45,401
I don't trust Wu Da.

489
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:46,881
He's too useless.

490
00:32:46,961 --> 00:32:48,080
Don't trust him?

491
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,600
So you went to peek at her

492
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:56,001
and did that disgusting thing
up in a tree?

493
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,761
I love Xiaole.

494
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:23,720
I truly love Xiaole.

495
00:35:23,761 --> 00:35:26,160
I haven't touched any woman
besides Xiaole.

496
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:31,321
But I... But I am a normal man.

497
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:34,120
Right? I have desires too.

498
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,600
Like Nabokov said,

499
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:40,560
Xiaole is my life's light,

500
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
my desire's fire.

501
00:35:43,961 --> 00:35:45,080
She is my goddess,

502
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:46,961
my soul,

503
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:50,560
and also my sin.

504
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,240
You're so shameless.

505
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:56,200
This isn't about shame.

506
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:58,801
It's beyond morality.

507
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:01,080
This is love.

508
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,001
Because I truly love her.

509
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:07,361
Xiaole was shining to me,

510
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,720
making everything else in the world dim.

511
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,801
All I can do is,

512
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,401
silently,

513
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:17,080
secretly,

514
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,680
far away in a corner, to watch over her,

515
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,401
bless her,

516
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:26,240
and love her.

517
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,881
It's been so long.

518
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:55,881
She's late, right?

519
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,281
If I were Chen Yumo,

520
00:36:58,281 --> 00:36:59,401
I'll just stand him up.

521
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,881
Stand him up. Please.

522
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:05,881
If I were meeting you, I'd be early.

523
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
We're waiting anyway.

524
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,921
Let's make a bet.

525
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,080
You learned some bad tricks.

526
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:15,680
Bet on what?

527
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,961
Bet on whether his crush shows up.

528
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,921
I bet she comes.

529
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,200
Then I bet she doesn't come.

530
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,080
Fine. If you lose,

531
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
promise me one thing.

532
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,001
If I lose,

533
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:27,441
I'll do whatever you say.

534
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:29,401
Deal.

535
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:30,481
Deal.

536
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,200
Deal.

537
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,520
Ye Qian.

538
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:21,001
You got here early?

539
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:23,281
You weren't here when I arrived,

540
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,520
so I came in first.

541
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,401
Let's go in.

542
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:28,361
Let's go.

543
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,841
M-My fault.

544
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,200
I jinxed it.

545
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:02,801
I'll go buy you qingbuliang.

546
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:04,160
No.

547
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,321
A bet's a bet.

548
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:09,881
Just to be clear.
I can't be your girlfriend.

549
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,401
Relax. It's definitely not that.

550
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,881
I'll go buy you qingbuliang.

551
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:23,921
Alright.

552
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,921
Let's talk about that.

553
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,281
On the night of the crime,

554
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:32,040
what were you doing
between 12 AM to 1 AM?

555
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,001
Sleeping at home.

556
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,120
With whom?

557
00:39:36,361 --> 00:39:37,160
By myself.

558
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
Where do you live?

559
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,881
Guanlan Court.

560
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,640
Think it over.

561
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,441
No need.

562
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:50,921
I'm a person with regular habits.

563
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:53,976
I have clinic hours at the Dongyuan
Health Center every Wednesday

564
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:55,321
just to go see Xiaole.

565
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:56,720
The clinic closes at 5 PM,

566
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,921
and she's home by 6 PM.

567
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,441
Then I went to the woods
and watched until 9:30 PM.

568
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:01,720
I went home after that.

569
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,761
Quite regular.

570
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,921
Take a look.

571
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,600
Yours, right?

572
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,640
Explain it.

573
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:32,080
About this question... I...

574
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:35,560
I-I don't know how to answer.

575
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:38,080
I did own an identical jacket
and the same bag.

576
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,080
But both items were stolen.

577
00:40:40,281 --> 00:40:41,040
Stolen?

578
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Where were they stolen?

579
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:44,120
Six months ago,

580
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:48,040
I kept that jacket as a spare

581
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,520
in the locker room
at the Dongyuan Community.

582
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,321
But my locker was pried open

583
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,921
and I couldn't find them.

584
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,120
Some colleagues and the security guards

585
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,200
can prove this.

586
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,881
Since the stolen items weren't valuable,
I didn't report it to the police.

587
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,040
Here. Qingbuliang.

588
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:17,441
I heard their qingbuliang is delicious.

589
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:18,640
Try some.

590
00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:21,040
Not in the mood.

591
00:41:35,441 --> 00:41:36,841
What kind of art exhibition?

592
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:38,240
It takes that long?

593
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:42,881
In my opinion,

594
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,600
Little Qian finally
got to see his unrequited love.

595
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,281
He must have
a lot of things to talk about

596
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:51,160
and memories to share.

597
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,001
He must cherish
every single moment with her.

598
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,281
Hey, where are you going?
The night snack is on me.

599
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:07,361
Wait, I came straight
after work to be with you.

600
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:08,240
I put in efforts.

601
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,281
Don't be mad.
I'll treat you to late-night snacks.

602
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,361
No. Too angry to eat.

603
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:13,321
Where are you going?

604
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:14,160
Going home.

605
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:17,680
Let me accompany you.
