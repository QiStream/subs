1
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,631
All these tragedies

2
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,301
began with Your Majesty.

3
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,598
Say that again.

4
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,391
It's Your Majesty's fault.

5
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,188
Say that again.

6
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,147
Your Majesty!

7
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,524
It's your fault.

8
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,623
Hong Eun-jo!

9
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,008
That's the person you see?

10
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,429
Does this mean Hong Eun-jo is now...

11
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,394
Young Master.

12
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,814
This is the last time I'm asking.

13
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,191
Say that again.

14
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,948
No.

15
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,536
If you go to the palace,
you'll put everyone in danger.

16
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,495
Don't you understand?

17
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,579
It should've been me.

18
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,207
I should be me!

19
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,671
Answer me.

20
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,716
I said, answer me!

21
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,802
Your Majesty!

22
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:18,930
Please stop.

23
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,390
Step aside.

24
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,100
Will you destroy everything yourself?

25
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,602
Was Hong Min-jik not enough for you?

26
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,579
Lady Jang.

27
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,373
Please return to your bedchamber.

28
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,627
All of you, withdraw at once.

29
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,589
The Grand Prince
will follow me to the main hall.

30
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,260
Halt the interrogation.

31
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,386
Yes, sir!

32
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,477
Yesterday, my son died.

33
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,897
Today, your father died.

34
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,774
Tomorrow, it could be your mother

35
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,026
and brother.

36
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,360
And then,

37
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,404
you could be the next.

38
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,740
When you're in the main hall,

39
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,451
please do not provoke His Majesty.

40
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,037
Please spare your life, Your Highness.

41
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,709
Don't worry.

42
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,468
Your Highness,
is the interrogation already over?

43
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,888
Hong-si must be headed to the palace now.

44
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,432
Tell her this when you see her.

45
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,645
There will be...

46
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,815
He said there would be no more mistakes?

47
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,026
He said you would know what it means.

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,033
So the State Tribunal was dismissed,
and he's alone with His Majesty?

49
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,998
Who is it?

50
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,837
I'm afraid I do not understand,
Your Majesty.

51
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,342
Who is this person standing in my way,
hiding behind you?

52
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,177
Stop!

53
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,764
Who is this person
speaking through you to blame me?

54
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,516
All these tragedies

55
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,976
began with Your Majesty.

56
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,519
I'm asking who this person is.

57
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,696
Was it you?

58
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,911
Were you behind everything?

59
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,257
Your Majesty,
Secretary Im Jae-i of the State Tribunal

60
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,509
urgently seeks an audience
with Your Majesty.

61
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,679
Let him in.

62
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,192
What is it?

63
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,529
We found evidence that Hong Dae-il
couldn't have been the assassin.

64
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,073
Bring her in.

65
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,930
Who are you?

66
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,266
My father's name is...

67
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,477
Hong Min-jik.

68
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
My young master took
the military examination every year,

69
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,649
but his archery scores were

70
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,110
never high enough
to even pass the first round.

71
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,946
He lacks the skill
to threaten Your Majesty.

72
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,909
Is this confirmed?

73
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,578
Her claim about his military exams
has been confirmed to be true.

74
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,705
Could that have been the intent?

75
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,957
If Hong had planned it
because of a personal grudge,

76
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,502
that would mean he deliberately
failed the exam for ten years,

77
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,212
like he knew the future.

78
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,255
And I believe
that could not have been the case.

79
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,557
I still haven't heard your answer.

80
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,855
Your Majesty has asked on whose behalf

81
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,566
I'm defending Hong Min-jik's eldest son.

82
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,155
It's probably myself.

83
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,493
I probably did it for myself.

84
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,832
Just like when I took the arrow

85
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,376
here that was meant for Your Majesty,

86
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,089
risking my own life.

87
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,685
The arrow meant to kill me
has saved your life.

88
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,771
This should repay what I owe you.

89
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,616
Send Hong Min-jik's son back home.

90
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,889
How was your father's final journey?

92
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,317
I just hope it was peaceful.

93
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,574
Is there anything you wish for
as condolence?

94
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,163
If my father offered advice
that was hard to hear,

95
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,333
it would have been meant for nothing else

96
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,001
but Your Majesty's own good.

97
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,174
Please remember the sincerity
with which he came before Your Majesty,

98
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,009
risking his own life.

99
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,722
That's the only thing I wish for.

100
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,615
Today,

101
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,283
you have seen nothing.

102
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,160
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,844
I took it to the main hall.

104
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,849
As I said,

105
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,893
I didn't want to make another mistake.

106
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,650
I learned that death
doesn't solve anything.

107
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,656
I took the dagger

108
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,199
to protect this body,

109
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,828
in case His Majesty hurt you.

110
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,960
I'm sorry you had to go through this.

111
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,390
Don't take this the wrong way.

112
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,226
I just want to see
if my body is all right.

113
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,946
Damn it.

114
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,906
Why now?

115
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,953
Why does everything
have to be so cruel to us?

116
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,769
Are you all right?

117
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,647
Yes, it's nothing.

118
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,691
I was told of your help, Your Highness.

119
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,402
Your mother must be worried.
You should hurry home.

120
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,990
Yes, Your Highness.

121
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,202
I'm sorry you went through that.

122
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,538
Let's go home.

123
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,625
Please go ahead.
We have something to talk about.

124
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,548
His Majesty has awakened?

125
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,300
Jae-i urgently sent a letter saying so.

126
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,058
Jae-i, not Lady Jang?

127
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,439
My head feels heavy.

128
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,362
Lady Jang woke up His Majesty.

129
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,407
Here's the decoction.

130
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,160
It disgusts me!

131
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,412
We'll have it prepared again.

132
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,789
Where's Geum-nok?

133
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,959
Lady Jang has caught a cold.

134
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,004
We isolated her
so she would not infect His Majesty.

135
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,135
Come in.

136
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,612
They should help ease
your weary mind, Your Majesty.

137
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,379
The Grand Prince
stopped the interrogation of Dae-il?

138
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,131
Yes, my lord.

139
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,717
You suspected someone
who can't even hit a target.

140
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,719
What?

141
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,928
Regarding Dae-il,

142
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,848
you were wrong.

143
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,766
From here on, let Jae-i handle it.

144
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,357
Does Grand Prince Dowol know Dae-il?

145
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,736
- That's--
- It's all because of that lowly girl.

146
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,201
I'm sure of it.

147
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,453
At the annex the other day...

148
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,794
Anyway,

149
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,047
the Grand Prince
fancies that concubine's daughter.

150
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,424
Why her?

151
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,640
He even stopped the interrogation.
Are his feelings that strong?

152
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,266
It means she's his soft spot.

153
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,809
She's just some girl.

154
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,603
What will you accuse the Grand Prince of?

155
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,355
- Well--
- He's from the royal family.

156
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,565
Even killing ten lowborns
wouldn't be a crime for him.

157
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,861
If it's a silly reason like
romantic feelings, I'm rather relieved.

158
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,073
Father, the Grand Prince must be removed
for me to return to my post.

159
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,115
Wait for now.

160
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,286
Once the bedchamber matter settles,
we can remove the Grand Prince anytime.

161
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,790
What's the bedchamber matter?

162
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,879
You're asking me a question.

163
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,300
You may go now, both of you.

164
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,431
I've been thinking about it,
but I just don't get it.

165
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,766
Why were we switched again?

166
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,561
The first time
might've been a twist of fate,

167
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,354
but now that it's happened twice,

168
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,690
I'm starting to think
it might just be our destiny.

169
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,067
Destiny?

170
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,112
Then destiny better have an answer

171
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,613
for why now, of all times.

172
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,076
That's what I thought
the first time our bodies were switched.

173
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,706
"Why does it have to be now?
So you'd find out about Gil-dong?"

174
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,378
But this time,
I'm glad it happened when it happened.

175
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,306
If our bodies haven't been switched,

176
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,725
you wouldn't have stopped.

177
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,310
Say that again.

178
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,980
You would have continued to confront him.

179
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,818
If that's the reason, why would we...

180
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,992
What's wrong?

181
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,413
You're right.

182
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,332
I would've confronted him.

183
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,626
You saved my life.

184
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,171
That's why we should live.

185
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,006
We should be alive

186
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,842
to find out the answer to why it's us.

187
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,553
You might be right.

188
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,767
We've already been switched once,
so it should be easier this time.

189
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,145
Still, things could change at any moment,

190
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,356
so let's share our daily schedules.

191
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,692
Let's meet at the bookshop in the market
around 4:00 every day.

192
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,914
I'll say goodbye here.

193
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,499
Go inside.

194
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,167
Don't worry about your family.

195
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,715
What's wrong?

196
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,635
I'm supposed to return
to the Hyeminseo tomorrow.

197
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,846
I have to make ends meet, after all.

198
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,683
Right. I'm sure you do.

199
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,726
Well, I guess there's no choice.

200
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,354
Just tell them you can't work for a while.

201
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,108
The Hyeminseo has already been
generous with you.

202
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,444
Not having you means
losing a helping hand.

203
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,655
I don't want to trouble them.

204
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,657
So you're going to the Hyeminseo?

205
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,158
Yes, I can give it a try.

206
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,079
Until things go back to normal,
we have to keep living the lives we're in.

207
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,540
It'll be hard.

208
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,583
Come on. What are you worried about?

209
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,794
I even survived your awful in-laws.

210
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,546
The Hyeminseo should be easy.

211
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,172
HYEMINSEO

212
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,353
Please, somebody help me!

213
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,522
Someone's dying here!

214
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,149
Please hurry!

215
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,657
Maybe she should quit the Hyeminseo.

216
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,577
I can open a big pharmacy for her.

217
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,879
Now, wipe it.

218
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,422
Yes, sir.

219
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,134
Not yourself, the patient.

220
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,552
Oh, the patient.

221
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,266
Fire.

222
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,687
Fire!

223
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,361
What are you doing?

224
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,907
Well, obviously, I'm starting a fire.

225
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,910
Come on. Don't try my patience.

226
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,997
Coming through! Move!

227
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,839
Oh, that was close.

228
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,263
Goodness.

229
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,683
Eun-jo is definitely
not herself right now.

230
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,853
What was that about Eun-jo?

231
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,563
My lady,

232
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,440
when your heart hurts,

233
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,025
it messes with your head.

234
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,568
What?

235
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,706
How's that?

236
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,629
It keeps slipping down when I run,

237
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,131
and it's really annoying.

238
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,716
It's much better now.

239
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,176
That's a smart trick.

240
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,638
Most women know this.

241
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,348
Right.

242
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,810
I keep forgetting things these days.

243
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,231
My lady.

244
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,901
Why don't we drop the formalities
when we're in private?

245
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,903
Like actual friends.

246
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,488
Friends?

247
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,323
Have they gotten closer?

248
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,075
Sure.

249
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,119
Lady Hae-rim?

250
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,288
Yes, when did you two get so close?

251
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,291
Ever since the prince showed up

252
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,002
to save the heroine
when she was in danger.

253
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,006
That is indeed my specialty.

254
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,384
How was the Hyeminseo?

255
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,844
It's hard, isn't it?

256
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:39,761
Not at all.

257
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,263
I had everything well in hand.

258
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,598
Oh, really?

259
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,558
That sounds very convincing.

260
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,393
- You don't believe me.
- I should.

261
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,352
I have to.

262
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,938
Anyway,

263
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,982
I gave it some thought,

264
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,152
and if we told our families about this,

265
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,113
they'd just think we'd lost our minds
and worry about us.

266
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,700
Why don't we tell Dae-chu about this
so we can communicate more freely?

267
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,452
Will he believe us?

268
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,623
So, in other words,

269
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,961
Hong-si is His Highness,

270
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,090
and His Highness is Hong-si.
Is that what you're saying?

271
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,808
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

272
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,984
Where are you going?

273
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,570
Not far. I'll be right back.

274
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,281
Stop right there.

275
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,116
Are you running away?

276
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,204
Look, Dae-chu,

277
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,791
I know it's hard to accept this reality.

278
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,419
No more shaking your head.

279
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,712
Your Highness.

280
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,637
Your Highness, Hong-si is acting like you.

281
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,598
Officer Seo.

282
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,102
Stay away.

283
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,019
Good.

284
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,647
I know you've been through a lot.

285
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,024
Anyone would've lost their mind.

286
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,526
I understand.

287
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,069
Let's get you treated.

288
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,699
After Hong Eun-jo's wedding,

289
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,867
you thought I was being strange
at some point, right?

290
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,828
Why do you think

291
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,496
"I did that?"

292
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,081
and "Oh, I did that" were

293
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,542
the only things
I was saying at some point?

294
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,004
That's exactly what I said
to His Highness.

295
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,216
Stop that! You almost fooled me.

296
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,428
Officer Seo, your lord

297
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,013
is not the kind of person

298
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,890
who would fold his own bedding
or clean for the court ladies.

299
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,941
Well done! Very meticulous.

300
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,402
You've been planning this just to fool me...

301
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,488
But why?

302
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,699
I wish I knew.

303
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:09,328
If we had known,
we wouldn't be looking at you like this.

304
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,838
Dae-chu,

305
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,882
I'll see you again tomorrow.

306
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,135
Bye.

307
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,723
Let's hurry back to the palace.

308
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:42,069
My whole body is aching
from dancing all day.

309
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,820
Don't you think His Majesty is a bit odd?

310
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,822
The king is no different
from any other man.

311
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,081
Be quiet.

312
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,127
Please come inside.

313
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,800
I hear the courtesans here
frequent the palace.

314
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,051
How does His Majesty party?

315
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,762
You must refrain from heavy drinking

316
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,556
and loose talk if you wish to live long.

317
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,101
I'm talking about both of us.

318
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,689
And why aren't you saying anything?

319
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,781
I'm considering

320
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,450
whether to speak

321
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,618
or hold my tongue.

322
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,839
I heard you wanted to see me.

323
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,929
I have something to say to you.

324
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,561
Once the bedchamber matter settles,
we can remove the Grand Prince anytime.

325
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,648
Please

326
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,525
be careful.

327
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,653
What do you mean?

328
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,988
I mean what I said.

329
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,408
Watch your back, day and night.

330
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,577
Just be careful in every way.

331
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,580
Wait,

332
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,583
if you're worried about me
'cause I stopped the interrogation--

333
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,792
I should get going.

334
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,796
Has he been drinking?

335
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,301
Are you all right?

336
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,016
Why do you look worried?

337
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,273
I must be really drunk.

338
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,484
Stay here.
I'll get someone to take you home.

339
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,361
Now, you're worrying about me too?

340
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,949
I'm already overwhelmed

341
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,284
by her worries.

342
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,790
Your Highness knows who I'm talking about.

343
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,377
Hong Eun-jo.

344
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,681
Wait,

345
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,516
the Grand Prince knew?

346
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,229
When did he...

347
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,904
Mother,

348
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,573
I'm really sorry.

349
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,368
For what?

350
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,461
I promised
I would never let myself lift a finger,

351
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,006
but it ended in tears.

352
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,219
Eun-jo,

353
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,471
I'm just grateful

354
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,348
that the young master is safe,

355
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,184
and that you're here by my side.

356
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,522
Let's not think about anything else,

357
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,899
and just live like this.

358
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,323
The physician said
you shouldn't move around yet.

359
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,992
Go back inside.

360
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,160
I know my own body.

361
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,453
I'm all better now.

362
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,830
What?

363
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,581
Did you take the medicine?

364
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,708
Enough with the nagging.

365
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,419
By the way,

366
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,546
I was out cold from the medicine,
so I couldn't ask.

367
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,798
Are you close with the Grand Prince?

368
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,429
He sometimes comes by the Hyeminseo,

369
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,972
so we've spoken a few times. Why?

370
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,183
Because it's strange.

371
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,894
He was acting like he knew me well.

372
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,772
He was almost treating me
like we're family.

373
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,652
Wait, could it be...

374
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,405
That's right.

375
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,906
His Highness and I--

376
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,825
Is he thinking of me

377
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,993
as his future ally?

378
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,704
What?

379
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,832
Well, I do look like a loyal Jindo dog.

380
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,209
Young Master,

381
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,003
you really can't read people, can you?

382
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,465
I mean, isn't it strange
that he suddenly stepped up to help me?

383
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,258
I can't go to that side.

384
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,136
Don't worry.

385
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,180
I came to this side.

386
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,015
What are you saying?

387
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,060
Then why?

388
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,607
He said there was no special reason

389
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,650
for helping you.

390
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,447
He said it was simply
the right thing to do

391
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,742
in honor of the late lord.

392
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,246
He also said
he wanted to offer his deepest apologies

393
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,539
on behalf of the royal family,

394
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,626
though what's been done
cannot be forgiven.

395
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,466
Next time you see him,

396
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,885
pass along my thanks.

397
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,971
I was so overwhelmed earlier,
I forgot to say that.

398
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,727
He didn't do it to receive thanks,

399
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,312
and he's already received them.

400
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,147
Well...

401
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,858
That's what he said.

402
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,196
What a truly kind man.

403
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:47,809
Your Highness,

404
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,894
Her Majesty and
Chief State Councilor Han Seung-rok

405
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,397
are waiting at Her Majesty's residence.

406
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,234
I never learned
about the Chief State Councilor.

407
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,487
What's his relationship
with the Grand Prince, sir?

408
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,991
Please don't use honorifics with me
while wearing that face.

409
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,367
It feels too weird.

410
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:05,994
I won't.

411
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,912
I don't really believe it.

412
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,414
I'll just consider this

413
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,791
a strange little game
the two of you are playing.

414
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,294
That way, I'll feel less crazy.

415
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,921
If you want.

416
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,176
The Chief State Councilor
is on good terms with everyone.

417
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,719
He's an easygoing man.

418
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:23,636
Is that so?

419
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,765
Thank you for stepping up
for Min-jik's eldest son.

420
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,559
I know my late friend
would be deeply grateful.

421
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,647
He was the lord's friend.

422
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,524
It's nothing.

423
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,112
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
I have only caused you concern.

424
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:45,909
Imagine if that family
had lost their only son as well.

425
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:49,120
I would've been too ashamed
before the late Lord Hong.

426
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,417
You've been showing
a new side lately, Your Highness.

427
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,545
If His Late Majesty had seen this,

428
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,964
he would have been greatly pleased.

429
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,510
Thank you.

430
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,178
His Late Majesty had seen

431
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,764
Your Highness' brilliance early on.

432
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,394
He didn't see his future
as an idler though.

433
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,613
Was it busy again today?

434
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,989
Yes.

435
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,827
What are you doing later?
Do you want to go see the moon?

436
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,286
That sounds nice.

437
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,746
But let's go another time.

438
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,747
I'm meeting someone.

439
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,211
You looked excited when you said that.

440
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,380
Is it someone you hold dear?

441
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,384
Oh, my. Really?

442
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,345
I didn't say anything.

443
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,348
Oh, dear.

444
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,767
Tell me. What's that person like?

445
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,854
I don't know.

446
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,605
Come on, tell me.

447
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,487
Someone who drifts farther away

448
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,073
when I get close.

449
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,201
I see.

450
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,830
I suppose that's how it is
when you like someone.

451
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,666
Do you have someone like that?

452
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,960
Yes.

453
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,214
He has someone he will never forget
for the rest of his life.

454
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,884
He has a serious problem.

455
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,846
I think I have a problem too.

456
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,683
Even the kindness he shows

457
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,518
by keeping his distance

458
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,521
touches my heart.

459
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,400
I'm running away,

460
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,943
somewhere

461
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,403
far behind her.

462
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,907
That story...

463
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,327
He's quite a charming man, isn't he?

464
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,710
I think you should let go of that man.

465
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,463
What?

466
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,131
So you can let someone else

467
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,884
into your kind heart.

468
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,516
Is anyone here?

469
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,061
Everyone went home. Who could that be?

470
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,030
What's wrong?

471
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,866
The kids are sick.

472
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,585
It's been over an hour already.
Why hasn't she shown up?

473
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,965
Maybe it's still busy at the Hyeminseo.

474
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,012
This is the barn.

475
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,015
We sold all the cows and horses.
There's only one cow left.

476
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,794
You're burning up.

477
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,129
What?

478
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,840
When did these street urchins
crawl in here?

479
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,675
Did you find them?

480
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,386
- Move the children to the carriage.
- Yes, my lady.

481
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,106
HYEMINSEO

482
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,315
What's going on?

483
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,650
These kids are sick.

484
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,569
The Gwangtong Bridge kids.

485
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,612
Let's take them to the dispensary.

486
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,832
I need fermented soybeans,
apricot kernels, perilla seeds, cork bark.

487
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,710
Soybeans, apricot kernels,
perilla seeds, cork bark. Got it.

488
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,638
Just one more spoonful,

489
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,141
and the fever goblin in your head
will run away.

490
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,604
There you go.

491
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,445
Her fever has gone down.

492
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,740
She should be better by tomorrow.

493
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,452
I'm impressed by how smoothly
you picked out the medicine.

494
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:43,247
You almost seem like a different person
when you're with the children.

495
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,833
Well...

496
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,377
I just remembered something
I came across in a medical book.

497
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,297
Do you come by the Hyeminseo often?

498
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,216
Right.

499
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,051
I once donated some medicinal herbs here.

500
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,221
I just want to make sure
they're not being wasted.

501
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,555
I see.

502
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,100
That's how the two of you know each other.

503
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,770
Do you need more warm water?

504
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,939
Eun-jo.

505
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,239
Sorry.

506
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,046
Are you sure
you can stay here by yourself all night?

507
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,882
Like I said, don't worry.

508
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,175
What about tomorrow?

509
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,593
Do you think you can handle it?

510
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,304
You have to trust me.
There's no other way.

511
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,057
Attention.

512
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,434
Quiet. Stay in line.

513
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,353
We have one goal.

514
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,480
It's to scrub the grime off our bodies.

515
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,565
Understand?

516
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,732
Yes, ma'am!

517
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,151
Now, into the water!

518
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,235
Into the water!

519
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,699
Kids, you're not here to play.

520
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,492
Scrub hard, all right?

521
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,911
I knew it.

522
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,497
What are you doing here?

523
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,249
Are you here to watch me?

524
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,168
You said you once fell into the water.

525
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,128
I came to make sure you weren't drowning.

526
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,005
I learned how to swim after that.

527
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,673
Now, I can swim like a fish.

528
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,924
Do you want to see?

529
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,384
No, thanks. Will you sit down?

530
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,719
I need help.

531
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,889
Blow.

532
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,224
Good job.

533
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,269
Do I have to use these hands for that?

534
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,104
Blow.

535
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,274
You should do it too.

536
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,358
Now, blow.

537
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,656
Well done. What a talented kiddo.

538
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,783
Hey, what was that?

539
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,493
You started it, all right?

540
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,623
You little rascal.

541
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,876
They made me so worried yesterday,

542
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,213
and now they're playing
like they were never sick.

543
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,756
They must've really startled you.

544
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,056
Those sick kids
are so much calmer than me,

545
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,351
as if a stomach bug from spoiled food

546
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,019
were not a big deal.

547
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,901
You said you found them in a barn?

548
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,781
That place was so stinky,
I could barely breathe in there.

549
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,951
I don't know why they were there.

550
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,916
They had fevers, their bodies were cold,

551
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,209
and they had no home to go to.

552
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,338
I'm sure they sneaked in there
to get some rest.

553
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,217
How did they lose their parents?

554
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,680
Wars, exploitation, neglect.

555
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,807
It's a typical story.

556
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,602
It should not be typical.

557
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,855
Especially for children.

558
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,984
There's been a plague recently,

559
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,820
so it must be even worse
outside the capital.

560
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,034
And Lord Hong must have seen that

561
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,578
and run to the hunting ground.

562
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,457
Because His Majesty

563
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,001
does not care about the people at all.

564
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,213
If the one who sits on the throne changes,

565
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,301
will the world change?

566
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,929
At the very least,
we will be able to change tomorrow

567
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,473
and the days that follow.

568
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,692
Do you really think it will change?

569
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:24,779
What do you mean?

570
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,740
The future of these children.

571
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,542
Could you pass the rest over?

572
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,494
Your Majesty,

573
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,080
how is your health?

574
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,875
I am well now, thanks to your concern.

575
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,627
Your Majesty,

576
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,589
I wish to know the reason
for Hong Min-jik's execution.

577
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,637
Why?

578
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,391
To record his crime, Your Majesty.

579
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,601
May I record that the offense was

580
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,521
provoking Your Majesty's anger
and troubling Your Majesty's mind?

581
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,860
Yes, you may.

582
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,240
From this moment on,
let Hong Min-jik's name

583
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,992
never be spoken again.

584
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,955
Whoever speaks his name again
shall be put to death.

585
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,381
I shall bear it in mind, Your Majesty.

586
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,177
I shall bear it in mind, Your Majesty.

587
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,109
They are afraid as well,

588
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,905
knowing, in this kingdom,
even nobles can be killed for no reason,

589
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,824
like beggars in the streets.

590
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,220
Chief Secretary Im.

591
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,601
Yes, Your Majesty.

592
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,437
I definitely saw it.

593
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,732
I saw the tiger roaming in Mount Dogo.

594
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,901
Your Majesty,

595
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,070
please forget what happened that day.

596
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,575
I really must be

597
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,119
losing my mind.

598
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,956
That is untrue, Your Majesty.

599
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,041
Your Majesty is
the late king's legitimate heir.

600
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,336
The ruler of Joseon, ordained by fate.

601
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,804
If Your Majesty commands it,

602
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,641
I will burn down the mountains
to catch the tiger.

603
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,309
And if that still is not enough,

604
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,897
I will pray to drag Hong Min-jik's soul
back to this world.

605
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,276
However,

606
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,280
please do not reveal
Your Majesty's shortcomings to anyone.

607
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,907
Let no one doubt

608
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,034
the authority of the throne.

609
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,460
It shall be done.

610
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,381
I am deeply grateful, Your Majesty.

611
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,514
What's the matter?

612
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,643
Nothing. I just felt
something strange behind me.

613
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,895
Sweetie, look.

614
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:31,233
From now on,
they'll be your brothers and sisters.

615
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,902
You can call me

616
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,030
Father from now on.

617
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,531
You're their father? How?

618
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,117
You'll be their mother, right?

619
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:45,331
All their living expenses will be covered,
until they're grown,

620
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,874
by this gentleman here.

621
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,421
I know it's a lot to ask. Thank you.

622
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:53,422
It's nothing.

623
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,759
It would've been too lonely
with just me and my baby anyway.

624
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,762
What are you doing?
Come, take a look around your new home.

625
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,105
Wow, I've never been
in a house with a roof.

626
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,107
I've never been in a house with walls.

627
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,360
I've never been in a house with blankets.

628
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,070
Everything is new to them.

629
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,863
Now I want to give them more.

630
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,365
Let's eat.

631
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,908
Yes!

632
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,539
They emptied the whole pot.

633
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,295
Where are you going?

634
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,965
I should go get more bowls
and pillows for the kids.

635
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,300
Do you even have to ask?

636
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,678
You're a bachelor.
You've never even raised a kid.

637
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,347
I should go with him.
Please take care of the kids.

638
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,391
Sure. Go ahead.

639
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,520
I'm so tired.

640
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,653
Are the kids asleep?

641
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,123
It was like a battlefield before.

642
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,916
Now it's finally quiet.

643
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:16,588
On the street, every day
must've been like a battle for them.

644
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,135
Now, all they need to do
is grow up safe and well here.

645
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,931
We should come by from time to time
until they're all grown.

646
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,226
I guess we should.

647
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,395
It will take at least ten years, right?

648
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,775
Until the youngest one grows up, yes.
That sounds about right.

649
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,031
Should we send them to school?

650
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,412
It'd be better
to have them taught at home.

651
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,875
Let's raise them as scholars,
not soldiers.

652
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,419
Come on, blades over books.

653
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,671
You need real skills.

654
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:00,132
There's a quicker path to success.
They should be scholars.

655
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,969
When it comes to making a living,
I know better.

656
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,554
I can't compromise on this.

657
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,139
You'll have to back down on this one.

658
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,060
This is why they say
you never know until you live together.

659
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,354
What did you just say?

660
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:15,856
Speak up.

661
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,816
I said...

662
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,067
I want to live like this

663
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,402
for a long, long time.

664
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,946
It didn't sound like that.

665
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,826
You're right.

666
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,247
I was saying we'd be together

667
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,499
for ten years at least.

668
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,337
And that's more than enough.

669
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,839
That's what I said.

670
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,180
By the way,

671
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,976
I heard you were planning to leave.

672
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,689
Were you going somewhere far away?

673
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,528
I just wanted to wander.

674
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,698
Because I made a promise.

675
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,326
Please leave Joseon

676
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:11,870
for Eun-jo's sake.

677
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:12,788
TONGJEONG DAEBU DAESAGAN

678
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,956
THE TOMB OF THE RESPECTED GENTLEMAN
OF THE NAMYANG HONG CLAN

679
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,208
I was going to leave to protect her,

680
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,712
but right now,
I cannot protect her if I leave.

681
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,715
Please let me keep my promise

682
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,426
this way.

683
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,435
I guess you can't keep that promise

684
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,397
now that our bodies are switched.

685
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,607
I'll try to keep it

686
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,859
while watching you, by your side.

687
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,616
The sky is so clear.

688
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,166
It's as if everything is all right.

689
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,930
Is this a tonic for restoring strength?

690
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,056
Yes, my lady.

691
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,768
I should give it
to the Gwangtong Bridge kids.

692
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,978
Again?

693
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,690
You've been getting
between those two a lot lately.

694
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,484
What do you mean?

695
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,113
It's obvious that the Grand Prince
and Physician Hong have a thing going on.

696
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,827
Sorry.

697
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,792
I hear you've been visiting
Lord Hong's grave a lot lately.

698
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,170
I'm running away,

699
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,671
somewhere

700
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,506
far behind her.

701
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,342
Is that woman then...

702
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,138
Kkot-sim,

703
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,183
could you deliver a letter
to the Grand Prince's residence?

704
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,776
You said you'd come visit,
so I was waiting for you.

705
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,819
I have something to ask, Your Highness.

706
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,489
What is it?

707
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,615
Do you...

708
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,036
and Eun-jo...

709
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,537
I can't hear you.

710
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,624
I mean...

711
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:24,961
Hide!

712
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,508
What's wrong?

713
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,719
If she sees you with me,
it'll cause unnecessary misunderstanding.

714
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,766
Do you know her?

715
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,774
Yes, a little.

716
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,405
It looks like it could rain at any moment.

717
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,449
Just like the day
I met Your Highness for the first time.

718
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,203
It was at the royal wedding ceremony,
back when I was young.

719
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,414
Right.

720
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,374
I remember now.

721
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,169
Oh, I forgot.

722
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,755
Your Highness couldn't attend
the ceremony at the time.

723
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,676
You fell ill during the epidemic,
and were staying at the royal villa.

724
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,430
Right. I was young,
so my memories are vague.

725
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,889
I caught the disease, yes.

726
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:18,974
Now I remember.

727
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,394
You remember things you never did?

728
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,565
Your Highness
did attend the ceremony that year.

729
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,401
I made up the epidemic story,

730
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,652
and that lady was

731
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,320
Her Majesty the Queen Consort.

732
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,827
Who are you?

733
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,454
Well...

734
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,666
She should've denied it to the end.
So what happened?

735
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,127
She says he's not in his senses
so he should pray harder.

736
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,421
She's reacting
pretty much the same way I did.

737
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,762
I'm sure you already heard about it.

738
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,891
Well, I guess that's how things are now.

739
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,562
Lady Hae-rim, are you okay?

740
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,733
You're taking this joke too far.

741
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,235
I wish this was a joke more than anyone.

742
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,489
Wait, that tone, that attitude...

743
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,742
I didn't mean to fool you.

744
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,495
Are you really Eun-jo?

745
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:24,915
Since when?

746
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,249
When were you the Grand Prince

747
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,251
and when were you Eun-jo?

748
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,631
I was the one who helped you
when you were with the other ladies.

749
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,675
Then who helped me
when I was with my brother?

750
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,886
That was me.

751
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,182
I know it's confusing.

752
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,435
There have been two phases.
We were switched again after the funeral.

753
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,563
I can't believe this.

754
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,024
Officer Seo,

755
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,609
do you believe this?

756
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,862
At times like this, I'd rather play along.

757
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:00,367
If what they're saying is true,

758
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,619
the two of them are...

759
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,623
Are they really bound by fate?

760
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:10,669
Wait.

761
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,588
There have been two phases.
We were switched again after the funeral.

762
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,132
After? That means...

763
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,759
Then two days ago...

764
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,053
Even the kindness he shows

765
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,805
touches my heart.

766
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,350
That was His Highness?

767
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:27,894
My lady!

768
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,022
What happened?

769
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,441
I made a confession.

770
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,988
Did you tell the lord
about the jewelry you sold

771
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,447
to help the Gwangtong Bridge kids?

772
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,325
No.

773
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,661
It was a confession of love.

774
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,539
HYEMINSEO

775
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,208
Be careful.

776
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,254
Have a safe trip home.

777
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,091
Thank you.

778
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,156
Her Majesty has sent word.

779
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,742
Again?

780
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,285
Today, she's with Lady Sukeui.

781
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,370
Lady Sukeui?

782
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,581
Is she an ally?

783
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,001
An enemy?

784
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,211
She's an ally. Don't worry.

785
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,109
Did you send for me?

786
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,362
Have a seat.

787
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,322
Lady Sukeui came by.
It's been quite a while.

788
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,452
It's nice to meet you...

789
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,912
Gil-dong.

790
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,210
Lady Sukeui was
His Late Majesty's concubine.

791
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,510
In the Gyeongo Year,

792
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:27,138
Lady Sukeui's son, Prince Yeonghu,
was killed by His Majesty.

793
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,100
Now, who wishes to follow my father

794
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,644
into death?

795
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,314
I would like to send him my regards.

796
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,776
After that, she turned to Buddhism.

797
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,737
It's good to see you, Grand Prince.

798
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,874
May I ask

799
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,043
why you wanted to see me?

800
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,254
I was looking forward to seeing you.

801
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,633
HYEMINSEO

802
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,433
You act like you don't even know me.

803
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,189
Come with me.

804
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,400
There's something I want to show you,

805
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,319
Gil-dong.

806
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,712
Can I ask something?

807
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,423
Sure, go ahead.

808
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,883
For the past few days,

809
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,260
you've been reading nothing
but books about treason.

810
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,557
I don't know
if you're His Highness or Hong-si,

811
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,893
but why are you studying that?

812
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,148
I can't tell you right now.

813
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,609
But I can promise you this.

814
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,778
Whatever choice I make,

815
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,821
it will protect your lord.

816
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,825
All right.

817
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,206
EXPLANATIONS ON THE COMPREHENSIVE MIRROR
FOR AID IN GOVERNMENT

818
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,128
The desire to change the world
has always existed.

819
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,213
MENCIUS

820
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,131
Rebellion, uprising,

821
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,175
revolt, upheaval.

822
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,845
Whatever it's called,
there's only one thing they seek.

823
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,890
Hong Min-jik's death
has shaken the ministers.

824
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,685
Hong Min-jik was His Majesty's teacher.
Now that even he has been killed,

825
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,647
they will think that no one's life
is safe anymore.

826
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,274
The time is drawing near.

827
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,194
Now, we must decide
which prince to place on the throne.

828
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,363
We must establish a new ruler

829
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,324
so that we can persuade
and rally the other scholar-officials.

830
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,785
It seems like the decision has been made.

831
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,414
It was also the late king's wish.

832
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,793
Are we all agreed?

833
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,878
Yes, Your Highness.

834
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,065
The prince we will place on the throne is

835
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,024
Yi Yeol,

836
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:26,818
Grand Prince Dowol.

837
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,949
They're plotting against the king.

838
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,243
A new ruler.

839
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,747
This is why Lady Sukeui
came to see the Grand Prince.

840
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,338
It's past curfew.

841
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,381
What's the matter?

842
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,426
The time is drawing near.

843
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,561
Is everything all right?

844
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,190
The prince we will place on the throne is

845
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,357
Yi Yeol,

846
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,443
Grand Prince Dowol.

847
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,114
Let's go.

848
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,366
You'll be in danger if you stay here.

849
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,451
What's going on?

850
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:20,121
They're trying to put Gil-dong
at the forefront of treason.

851
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,039
Let's run away.

852
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,541
Somewhere far from the palace,

853
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,792
somewhere far from Joseon,

854
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,503
somewhere no one knows us.

855
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,474
I...

856
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:41,976
can't go.

857
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,107
You already

858
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,777
knew.

859
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,160
You already made up your mind.

860
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,454
You were already

861
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,165
with them.

862
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,770
Once you're caught as a traitor,
you'll be torn limb from limb.

863
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,188
If we go back to our own bodies,

864
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,857
I'll join them as Gil-dong.

865
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,774
How can you

866
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,193
speak of death so lightly in front of me?

867
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,112
Play the music louder!

868
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,447
My ears are ringing!

869
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,240
In a world like this,

870
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,367
I have no choice but to live as a thief.

871
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,368
Now, you know

872
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,204
the very things I wished
you didn't know about my life.

873
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,372
Are you ready?

874
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,626
I will make a world
where I don't need to live

875
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,252
as a thief.

876
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,797
