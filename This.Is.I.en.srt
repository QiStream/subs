1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,916
You're participating
in the Miss International Queen pageant.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,916
Please tell our audience how you feel.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,375
I'm so nervous, but I'm so excited
to take the throne today.

4
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,625
You're really sure about yourself?

5
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,666
-Yes.
-Let me get one brush.

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,333
-Water?
-No. Right here. One more touch.

7
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,166
All right. No problem.

8
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:53,458
Excuse me! Move aside, please! Move aside!

9
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,250
Large object coming through!

10
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:56,875
You found it.

11
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,541
Excuse me.

12
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,458
-Excuse me.
-That's your chair.

13
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:05,041
I got a new hairdo…

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,708
SEIKO MATSUDA

15
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:11,291
You say I look so different

16
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:17,833
You're looking pretty bashful…

17
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:23,291
As you walk past me…

18
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,666
What are you doing? Hurry up. Let's go.

19
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,916
You heard your father. Go change.

20
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,125
Hmm… You stupid-head!

21
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,750
It's almost over, let him finish.

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,791
You're always hesitating…

23
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:49,625
It's like you're behind a wall…

24
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:53,000
Fresh, fresh, fresh!

25
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,041
Open the door to summer

26
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,958
And whisk me away somewhere

27
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,791
Fresh, fresh, fresh!

28
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,333
Summer's gonna Open the door

29
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:09,875
And take us just the way we are…

30
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,958
Man-woman!

31
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,291
You are so weird!

32
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,375
Okama!

33
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,708
Why are you all laughing?

34
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,916
I'm just singing a song
that I really like.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,750
Stop making fun of all my clothes.

36

KIDS AMATEUR SINGING CONTEST

Run!

38
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,583
Okay, next!

39
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,333
Ready,

40
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,250
set…

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,291
A car passes by…

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,125
We are on separate streets…

43
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,583
We both think that you should ask him out.

44
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,041
What are you waiting for? Just do it.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,333
I got a new bra yesterday.
It's really cute.

46
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,833
-What color?
-Pink.

47
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,208
-Pink looks so good on you.
-Yeah.

48
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,125
You say you love me…

49
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,208
DEAR TAKESHI, YOU'RE ALWAYS SO POSITIVE

50
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,250
Are you serious?

51
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,333
FROM KENJI

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,666
TO TAKESHI

53
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,500
But everyone's watching me…

54
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:22,666
How could you do that to me?

55
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,833
Fresh, fresh, fresh!

56
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:26,958
It's the man-woman!

57
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,166
DROP DEAD, LADYBOY

58
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,375
-You're so weird.
-He's an okama.

59
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,666
Look at that!

60
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,916
Hey, Kenji!

61
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,708
Why does everybody laugh at me?

62
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,583
I don't get it.

63
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,458
What the heck even am I?

64
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,791
What the hell am I?

65
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,500
Hey.

66
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,958
-You're drinking too much, Wada.
-You're a doctor, remember?

67
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,833
A doctor, huh?

68
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,708
A guy like me?

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,291
Hey, didn't you quit the police hospital
right after you signed up?

70
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,625
You're pretty odd for a skilled surgeon.

71
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,583
Hey! Did something happen?

72
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,083
All right, fine, I'll give you one…

73
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,833
Nothing happened.

74
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,583
It's just…

75
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,250
surgeons don't care
about the patients they operate on.

76
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,583
All they care about is the surgery.

77
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,291
You people only care about

78
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,708
the body parts.

79
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,291
The meat.

80
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,791
So tell us. What's your plan now, Wada?

81
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,166
Cosmetic surgery, I heard.

82
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,291
Work for someone else.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,541
It's true. You're right.

84
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,583
I can't save a single patient.

85
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:19,541
I just… I just make people look good.
I'm a fake doctor.

86
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,208
Tell me.

87
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,333
What is a doctor?

88
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,750
And medicine?

89
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,875
-I bet I think about that more than you!
-Whoa!

90
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,208
Hey, now!

91
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,750
-Oh! So much meat here.
-Don't throw that!

92
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,958
There's so much meat to… cut up!

93
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,250
-Hey, get away!
-I'm gonna kill you!

94
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,583
Oh, wow.

95
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,041
This place is so lively.

96
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,458
-It's so loud.
-Is that right?

97
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,333
-Hey.
-Hmm? What is it?

98
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,416
Can I, uh… skip school tomorrow?

99
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,083
My stomach hurts.

100
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,916
It's not gonna hurt tomorrow.

101
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,791
Should I rub your tummy?

102
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,625
Hmm?

103
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,375
Go to school.
Skipping can become a habit.

104
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,708
-All right.
-Mm.

105
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,500
What, where are you going? School?

106
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,458
The bathroom, stupid.

107
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,458
You should eat more. You hardly had any.

108
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,333
Shut up and die!

109
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,541
Shut up and die!

110
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,333
-Cry all you want!
-Crybaby!

111
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,708
Come on! Show us! Still!

112
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,125
Do you have a dick or not?

113
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,708
-Yeah!
-Stop squirming.

114
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,583
Look at all that makeup!
Look at him! I can get these!

115
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,875
What's wrong?

116
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:02,875
Ma'am…

117
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,416
Can you… please help me?

118
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,583
I can't take it anymore.

119
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,250
Onishi.

120
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,166
I'm sure you must have
some part in all of this.

121
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,916
Stop being so fragile.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,125
Try to be more masculine, all right?

123
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,250
But I didn't do anything.

124
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,583
I was just being myself.

125
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,833
What am I?

126
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,875
Someone please help.

You're part of me…

It's my journey

My life and my love

If you know what I mean

137
00:10:55,916 --> 00:11:00,666
If you know what mean, yeah-ah-ah-ah

138
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,250
Yeah-ah-ah-ah, yeah-ah-ah

Clouds drifting way up high…

140
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,375
Hey, stop the music!

141
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,416
-Come on, Megumi. You gotta smile more.
-All right.

142
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,875
-Jennifer, learn the choreography.
-Yep.

143
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,958
Marumi, you are doing way too much.

144
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,041
-Okay.
-All right, start from the top.

145
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,000
Who's this?

146
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,291
Who are you?

147
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,875
I just thought you were so beautiful.

148
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,833
But I… had a feeling
you weren't a regular woman.

149
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,833
So I got curious.

150
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,208
You're sharp, kid.

151
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,250
Most people rarely ever notice
that I have a dick.

152
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,291
I really…

153
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,916
My dream is to be an idol like Seiko.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,666
What are you talking about?

155
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,208
Do you think I could come
work here for you?

156
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,916
I want to be up on stage.
I want to dance and I want to sing.

157
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,333
I've never…

158
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,625
experienced anything like it.

159
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,375
Ever since…

160
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,375
Ever since I was little,
I've always wanted to wear pretty skirts,

161
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,791
but I had to wear pants
because I was a boy.

162
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,416
Everybody in my class… calls me "okama."

163
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,083
They call me a man-woman.

164
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,375
It's been painful.

165
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,416
I started to think
that I wasn't even human.

166
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,000
Stop with the tragic heroine victim act.

167
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,750
It's the same for all of us.

168
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,583
Everybody has their own sob story,
a lot of them worse than yours.

169
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,250
You're not special.

170
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,708
And if you pretend you are,
you've already lost.

171
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,500
I know it hurts but you'll be fine.

172
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
I'll show you the ropes.

173
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,541
-You mean that?
-An okama always keeps their word.

174
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,791
Never mind. They don't always.

175
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,500
Listen. I'll make one thing very clear.

176
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,750
It doesn't matter how much you do here,

177
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,291
you'll never become a real woman.

178
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,500
Okay.

179
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,791
Instead, what you can become is
what we call a "newhalf." Got it?

180
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,666
Thank you very much.

181
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,208
It's the top of the fourth inning,

182
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,916
and the Giants are up to bat.

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,625
Neither team has managed
to score any runs…

184
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,875
We get more surprise tests
than all the other classes.

185
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,333
It's unbearable.

186
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:36,250
So my friends…
want to study at the library after school.

187
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,583
Study at the library?

188
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,166
Yeah, me and my friends want
to study there.

189
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,125
Mm.

190
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,875
That's fine.

191
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,791
You're a man. Do it right.

192
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,333
I will.

193
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,375
Really? You've never studied
in your life. Not that I know of.

194
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,500
You better shut up.

195
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,583
Mm.

196
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,791
Your kimpira is delicious, Mom.

197
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,875
Kenji, you're so dedicated.

198
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,500
Let's see.

199
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,833
Will my grandson be
a doctor? A minister?

200
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,625
-Do your best.
-That's impossible.

201
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,833
Hey now. Don't say that to him.
He's trying as hard as he can.

202
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,750
I'm sorry, Grandma.

203
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,916
I don't think… I'm going to become
a doctor or a minister.

204
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,250
I'm going to be a newhalf.

205
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,416
-Did you get another boob job?
-Hah, You're just jealous of me, babe.

206
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,625
-Yeah, right.
-I picked up my prescription yesterday--

207
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,416
Come on!

208
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,625
How many pills are you taking?

209
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,041
-Five a day.
-What?!

210
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,500
-Five? Are you feeling okay?
-That's a reaction.

211
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,500
-I'm throwing up every day.
-I bet you are.

212
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,708
-That's awful.
-But my boobs are growing. See?

213
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,166
Dream come true.

214
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,083
-You feel like a real woman.
-It's worth it!

215
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,625
I get it, girl!

216
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,125
Oh yeah?
Wow, this doesn't sound like you at all.

217
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,458
It may not look like it,
but I get hormone shots

218
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,791
like a machine gun.

219
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,708
I still prefer my hormones from eating
yakiniku rather than pills though.

220
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,791
Hormones, hormones, hormones!

221
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,500
Hormones, hormones, hormones, hormones!

222
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:26,958
Place this carefully backstage,
then go to Aki's place.

223
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:31,083
Then… and then… um…

224
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,750
Hey, newbie.

225
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,458
Take this.

226
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,958
It's for our prescriptions.

227
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,166
Oh. O… okay.

228
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,208
I'm so pretty!

229
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,625
-Hey, what a cutie!
-Oh, you're right.

230
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,666
Please enjoy Miss Yamashita Kumiko's

231
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,791
"Sekido Komachi Doki."

232
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,916
The crimson sun

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,791
She scorches, she burns…

234
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,500
Hey Miss! Wanna grab some tea?

235
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,333
Even the shimmering heat

236
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,625
Comes alive when she walks by…

237
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,875
With her prim little face

238
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,625
Her gaze…

239
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,750
Is the mirror image of summer

240
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,208
Tilting her chic sunglasses

241
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,291
Her eyes meet yours…

242
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,458
-Okay!
-Ooh!

243
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,250
And she's got you Burning with nerves

244
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,250
She derails your train of thought

245
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,041
She's gonna set your fuse on fire…

246
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:42,750
Your jagged heart
Might tear apart in a jagged way

247
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,583
She's the belle of the equator

248
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,250
Love is the sweltering subtropics

249
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,791
She's the belle of the equator…

250
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:54,791
Whoo!

251
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,500
Watch out for her burning embrace

252
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,791
My heart! It pounds!

253
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,750
-Here you go.
-Thank you!

254
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,750
Ba-dump! Ba-dump!

255
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,583
She's the belle of the equator

256
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,333
Love is the sweltering subtropics

257
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,666
She's the belle of the equator…

258
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,625
Whoo! Whoo!

259
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,208
Watch out for her burning embrace

260
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,958
My heart! It pounds!

261
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,291

263
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,583
I already told you I'm fine with that!

264
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,416
I'll repeat myself again.

265
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,541
There's no point in messing
with your eyes any further.

266
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:34,791
If anything, your eyes will stay
as swollen as they are now.

267
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,208
Would you rather have
pig eyelids or double eyelids?

268
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,125
I told you my whole story.

269
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,083
And that's all you have to say to me?
Give me a better answer!

270
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,583
I'm giving you this advice
for your own good!

271
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,791
Who did this work on your nose, anyway?

272
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,500
Sue them, get compensation,
and then I'll try to fix it.

273
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,416
We're done here.

274
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,916
You're the worst ever!

275
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,833
I'll find a different doctor!

276
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,291
Think it over.
They'll just take your money!

277
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,875
Great.

278
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:06,958
I'm sorry.

WADA PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC
PREMARIN - JORDAN PUB

280
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,416
We are so beautiful, don't you think?

281
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,208
That's a stupid question.

282
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,708
-It was rhetorical.
-What?

283
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,125
I was talking to myself in the mirror.

284
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,958
You finally found someone
who will listen to you?

285
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,583
You should try to be more like me.

286
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,208
-No, thanks.
-Oh, please. This girl.

287
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,208
I swear.

288
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,541
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,625
I heard an uncomfortable conversation…

290
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,583
I got scared, so I left our card.

291
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,541
You bailed?

292
00:20:55,375 --> 00:21:00,041
-Well, that doctor's kind of rude.
-Okay, girl!

293
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,000
The dress is cute on you! Right?

294
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,833
Thank you very much!

295
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,708
-Mm-hmm.
-You better enjoy it while you can.

296
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,208
Won't be long
before you're bulging everywhere.

297
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,916
I was as thin as you are. Before.

298
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,291
The ones who bloom slowly at first
tend to grow a lot later on.

299
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,666
-You grew way too much.
-Who, me?

300
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,875
You know.

301
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:21,916
You said that!

302
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,958
What did you eat to get that big?

303
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,708
What's wrong, Kenji?

304
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,500
Do you feel sick?

305
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,500
I ate something bad.

306
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,208
I feel a lot better now.

307
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,708
-But you look pale.
-I'll be fine.

308
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,625
Please get some rest. Good night.

309
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,291
Hey, kid. You've had way too much.

310
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,166
I'm not talking about alcohol. The pill.

311
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,875
It'll mess you up.

312
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,041
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,583
I'll be careful.

314
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,083
As long as you understand.

315
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,041
Lecture's over. Go on.

316
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,583
Wait, kid. Come back. I have more to say.

317
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,125
What is it?

318
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,625
Your debut. You've been selected.

319
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,916
Do you mean that?

320
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,875
"Ai." How about that?

321
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,791
Ai?

322
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,291
It's your new name.

323
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,708
Kenji never really suited you.

324
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,791
I want "Ai" to be truly loved, kid.

325
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,333
Ai.

326
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,291
Where's Kenji?

327
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,000
He's been coming home really late.

328
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,583
He even dropped out of high school.
What's he thinking?

329
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,708
Ask him yourself if you're so worried.

330
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,125
Idiot. That's a mother's job.

331
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,375
Is this yours, Mom?

332
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,291
-Hmm?
-I found it on the floor.

333
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,750
-I don't own anything this flashy.
-What?

334
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,833
Well I guess…

335
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,708
No, no, no, not mine.

336
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,041
I would never.

337
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,250
Nope, I'm determined
never to cheat on you. Yeah--

338
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,291
-Why would you say that?
-Can't believe dad said that.

339
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,208
Will you all pardon me?

340
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,166
I know y'all want my balls!

341
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,166
What a weird place.

342
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:13,375
Single footsteps in the sand

343
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:17,750
A little free time to myself

344
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,333
I turn around

345
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,166
To a strange figure
Off in the distance

346
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,875
He rushes toward me on the shore

347
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:41,541
Suddenly a chill runs down my back

348
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:47,083
It is the sweet premonition of love

349
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,000
Coming over me

350
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:52,458
Our rendezvous

351
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:56,375
Is in slow motion

352
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:59,583
With a touch of giddy

353
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,208
And beckoning us in

354
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:07,208
Our rendezvous

355
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:10,750
Is in slow motion

356
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,416
In my eyes

357
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,916
This vision of you

358
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,958
Can you tell me what you do for work?

359
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm a doctor.

360
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,208
Amazing.

361
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,333
Hey. Hey, doctor.

362
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,750
How was my performance?

363
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,083
How was it?

364
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,375
It's just… today was my debut.

365
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:51,833
It was…

366
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,625
You shined so brightly.

367
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,625
Shining like a star.

368
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,291
You seemed so true to yourself.

369
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,875
It was like you were born to be on stage.

370
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,875
I'm a little drunk.

371
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:18,291
My mom made me a beautiful skirt to wear.

372
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:19,875
Really?

373
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,083
You actually wore it
to the singing contest?

374
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,125
Yeah, and the boys were all laughing.

375
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,708
They called me "gross."

376
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:33,875
And said I was a weirdo.

377
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:36,708
Weird.

378
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:40,291
What?

379
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:42,750
Well,

380
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,583
I think

381
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,333
being weird means that nobody accepts you.

382
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,875
So if even one person accepts you…
you're not weird.

383
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,375
That sounds cheesy.

384
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,250
I've never heard anything as nice as that.

385
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:12,083
Doctor, I kind of have a favor to ask you.

386
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,500
Okay, go ahead.

387
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:17,750
-I can't lend money, but something else--
-No, that's not it.

388
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,875
Cut my balls off.

389
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:26,750
Your balls?

390
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,375
Uh, you mean testicles.

391
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,333
Mm.

392
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,250
I looked it up.

393
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:43,000
I read that…
male hormones are made there, aren't they?

394
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,833
Which would mean…

395
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,291
they're what makes me masculine.

396
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,875
If that's true… getting rid of them--

397
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:54,375
Will make you more feminine.

398
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:57,708
Will you?

399
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:01,833
Well, technically… it's not impossible.

400
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,291
But you're thinking about this too simply.

401
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,708
There's the Eugenic Protection Law.

402
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:10,625
Orchiectomies aren't common.

403
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:16,041
Doctors have been arrested
for operating without permission.

404
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:20,000
Well I don't want you to get arrested.

405
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,125
I just kind of…

406
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:29,791
I always hoped that someday

407
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,666
those balls hanging
from my body would fall off.

408
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:38,125
That's when I would become my true self.

409
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,458
But they haven't yet.

410
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:50,250
It's just that no matter
how much time passes, they won't.

411
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,791
I'm even growing a beard now.

412
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,375
And my voice deepened.

413
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,750
I can't handle it.

414
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,333
I hate it.

415
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,333
I can't live like this.

416
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:19,875
It's awful.

417
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,208
Doctor.

418
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,166
Why are you here?

419
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,458
Obviously, I want to get
a surgery consultation.

420
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:46,583
I just need a little more time, okay?

421
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:48,750
Doctor!

422
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:01,291
Doctor. The surgery.

423
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:04,333
You can't do this on whim! Understand?

424
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,250
This is the end of your treatment.
You did a great job.

425
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,083
Wait. Doctor.

426
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,666
-You're releasing me as your patient?
-Hmm. That's right.

427
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:45,541
You can't leave me like this.

428
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,333
Please fix it.

429
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:50,416
My face isn't done yet!

430
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,833
The surgery was a success.

431
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,541
You should be grateful that you survived.

432
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,041
Not like this.

433
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:02,458
I can't live like this! I can't!

434
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:14,125
Doctor, is there something wrong?
You look so serious.

435
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,333
What does it mean

436
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,000
to save someone's life?

437
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:22,666
What?

438
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:26,083
No, never mind. I'm sorry.

439
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,500
Doctor.

440
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:05,708
Ai.

441
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:09,625
I'll do it.

442
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,083
I'll do your surgery.

443
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:17,291
You mean it?

444
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,958
Knowing you,
you'll keep pestering me until I agree.

445
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,041
But there are conditions.

446
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,458
Conditions?

447
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,666
You're going to have to tell
your parents, Ai.

448
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,958
Even if you can't tell them
about the operation,

449
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,791
you must tell them about how you feel.

450
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,625
This is so sweet.

451
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:53,333
I'm so gonna… get hit.

452
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:57,583
-What? What'd ya do?
-Nothing. Just keep eating, all right?

453
00:35:57,666 --> 00:36:01,250
Something's going on. I don't know what.

454
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,375
Yum.

455
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,458
-Hey.
-Hey.

456
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:12,750
Dad? Where's Mom?

457
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,041
Oh, she said she has
a neighborhood meeting.

458
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,458
-Got it.
-Mm.

459
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,291
Hey, um…

460
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,958
Can you go to that seat over there?

461
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,333
Why?

462
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,458
Can I order a cream anmitsu?

463
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,583
-Yeah.
-All right!

464
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,541
What did you want to tell me?
Hurry up, the race is about to start.

465
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,916
Okay. I'll say it quick then.

466
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:50,875
I uh…

467
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,875
Yes?

468
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:56,375
-This might kinda surprise you…
-Uh-huh?

469
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,375
I, uh…

470
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,500
I want to live as a girl.

471
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,458
I know I was born a boy,

472
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,750
but I want to live as a girl from now on.

473
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,166
Do what you want.

474
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,041
You've already made your decision.

475
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:12,791
So do it.

476
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,291
Wait a sec.

477
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,500
Did you know already?

478
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,541
I am your father. No matter what.

479
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:38,291
I thought you'd be more…
masculine if I made you play baseball.

480
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,416
I'm sorry.

481
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,500
Just promise me one thing.

482
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,541
What is it?

483
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:56,416
Never regret your decision, all right?

484
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:00,833
And take care of yourself.

485
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:05,291
If you're a man, then be the best man!

486
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,750
That's three things to promise, not one.

487
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,083
And…

488
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,083
I just told you
I'm going to live as a girl.

489
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,333
-Huh?!
-All right, fine.

490
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:19,750
I promise it all.

491
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:21,916
Oh and…

492
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:27,333
…don't tell… your mother about this.

493
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,083
I think it'll break her.

494
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,625
Are you having second thoughts?

495
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:42,833
No.

496
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,875
Except…

497
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:51,583
I feel bad for my mom.

498
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,916
She gave birth to a healthy baby.

499
00:39:58,416 --> 00:39:59,583
We can stop.

500
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:00,666
Mm-mm.

501
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,583
I'll apologize to her someday.

502
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,125
Doctor.

503
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,541
Hmm?

504
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,083
I'm glad you said that you'd help.

505
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,875
There's no one else I would want here.

506
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,166
Why me?

507
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:32,333
Because of what you said.

508
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:34,458
Hmm.

509
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,750
That I shine like a star.

510
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,875
And that…

511
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,875
…made me really happy.

512
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,791
I want you to know something.

513
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,916
In my eyes, you're not weird.

514
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,916
I'm really glad to hear that.

515
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,458
I want to be…

516
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,166
Ai, the idol.

517
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,916
Like Seiko, who's my idol.

518
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:32,041
To be an idol of idols.

519
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,375
You'll be one.

520
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:54,416
Because you're you.

521
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,625
Oh, it's swollen like a balloon.

522
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:30,000
Even if you take the balls,
the sack's still there.

523
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,750
-My God. It looks like that…
-What?

524
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:32,833
-You know that…
-What?

525
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,208
-I've got a picture of it.
-What?

526
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,625
It doesn't look like anything.

527
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:37,500
-You wait.
-What does it look like?

528
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:40,875
Where did I put that picture?
Where is it? Where did I…

529
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,166
What's going on here?

530
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,791
Ai took out her balls.

531
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,916
-Get a good look, isn't this special?
-Ha.

532
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,458
-Come here!
-There you are.

533
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:52,041
Aw! It looks just like that…
you girls know, that raccoon dog!

534
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,791
-That's what I thought!
-Oh yeah!

535
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:56,750
This!

536
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,666
They look exactly the same!

537
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,500
No, wait! Please don't say that!

538
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,083
Ai.

539
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,166
How's it make you feel, huh?

540
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,458
How do I feel?

541
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,291
It's like I've been liberated!

542
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:22,083
Oh really?!

543
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,291
You said that!

544
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,916
Let's go out for drinks!

545
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:35,583
Ai! Ai! Ai! Ai! Ai! Ai!

546
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:39,500
-Go, Ai! Go, Ai! Go, Ai!
-Yes, queen!

547
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:47,875
Dipping my feet in the icy fountain

548
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,791
Looking up at the skyscrapers

549
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:55,375
Wearing my favorite clothes

550
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:59,333
There's nothing wrong with that

551
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:04,916
Gripping the golden handlebars
Racing through the town

552
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,125
Doing all these fun things

553
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:13,500
I want to see
What it really looks like

554
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:16,791
And not just through an old TV screen…

555
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,916
The moment the needle drops

556
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,500
Is the moment my heart skips…

557
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,125
Doctor, you removed Ai's balls, right?

558
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:29,375
So you're the famous doctor
who treats us "newhalfs."

559
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,625
All the Kansai okama,
they're all coming here

560
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,208
because you're great!

561
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:34,875
Hold still. I need it to be aligned.

562
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,958
Even if I'm tired, hated,
Or growing old, I just can't stop…

563
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,500
-Your hair!
-You're so cute.

564
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:42,875
I could just butter you up and eat you!

565
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:47,125
They're like diamonds…

566
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:51,625
Every which way I look

567
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:57,208
I can't quite put it into words

568
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,625
But they are treasures

569
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,500
My hunch was right

570
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:09,166
It's exactly how I thought it would be

571
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:14,375
It's setting me in motion

572
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:17,416
-This feeling of mine
-Oh! Oh!

573
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:22,125
It's your fault! You are guilty!

574
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:26,833
Oh, Doctor.

575
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,375
WHAT ABOUT NORMAL PATIENTS?

576
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:45,458
DIE

577
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:48,208
Why do people do this?

578
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,666
Our clients fight so hard just to survive.

579
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,625
A lot more than these jerks.

580
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,833
Excuse me. Are you with the clinic?

581
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:08,875
Yes, I am.

582
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,333
I'm Detective Tsuruku.

583
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,833
We've been getting a lot of complaints

584
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:16,541
about the noise coming
from the lines at your clinic.

585
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:21,500
I guess… those unique people talk a lot.

586
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,291
I apologize.

587
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:27,875
I'll make sure we keep the noise down.

588
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:29,291
Appreciate it.

589
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:33,125
Isn't it tough to keep control
of so many strange freaks?

590
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,333
Don't call them that.

591
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:39,041
Well then.

592
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:54,875
Ai, you're unbelievably cute, ya know.

593
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,750
-Takuya, you do know, right?
-Huh?

594
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,291
I'm not… a normal kinda girl.

595
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,166
I don't care about that.

596
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:07,500
Ah!

597
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:10,041
I want you so bad right now.

598
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:11,708
Wanna live together?

599
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,250
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes!

600
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,875
Really?!

601
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,083
-You promise?
-Uh-huh.

602
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:22,041
Oh. I'm on. See you later, okay?

603
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:23,625
-Okay.
-All right!

604
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:25,208
Mm.

605
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:27,125
I'm serious!

606
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,291
Sorry!

607
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,000
Ai.

608
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:36,541
Aki.

609
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,583
I'm just meddling here.

610
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:45,375
But all the men who mess with newhalf…
always go back to women.

611
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,083
You should be prepared for that.

612
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,250
Well… I'll come visit.

613
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:12,250
Oh! I'll be lonely without you here.

614
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:13,750
He's not going abroad.

615
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:14,750
I know.

616
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:18,041
-Yeah. You better… come by sometimes.
-You got it.

617
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:23,250
Hey! Aren't you coming out?

618
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,958
Kenji's leaving.

619
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:27,333
I'm a little busy.

620
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,333
-See you later.
-Mm.

621
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,333
Take care. Mm.

622
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:17,958
Takuya!

623
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:19,625
-Her and me!
-Ah!

624
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:20,833
It's a scandal!

625
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,291
Ha!

626
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:28,541
Nice!

627
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:30,875
-Yeah, I did!
-A deadly game of love

628
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:33,750
A forbidden scandal

629
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:36,750
No matter how much I love you…

630
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:39,208
-Stop!
-Come on, scaredy-cat!

631
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:41,416
Let's eat!

632
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,916
We kissed by the pool

633
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,916
And then you cried…

634
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,666
Oh, no. There's ketchup on your face.

635
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:52,375
-Do you want seconds?
-Oh my God! Yeah!

636
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,500
I can't stop loving you

637
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:05,375
Even if it's forbidden

638
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:11,625
If only I could let you go

639
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:13,750
Then you wouldn't have to--

640
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,666
-Uh?
-Hmm?

641
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,625
-Who's that?
-You don't have to answer that.

642
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:20,958
Yes, I do.

643
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:22,541
-It's all right.
-Coming!

644
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:24,791
Uh…

645
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,333
Hello?

646
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:33,541
Who is it?

647
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:37,708
-A ding-dong ditch?
-Maybe a neighbor.

648
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,166
-We were loud, you know.
-It's fine. Come on!

649
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,583
Come on and do what?

650
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,708
Make out, duh!

651
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:51,375
You know…

652
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,750
I think I'm the happiest I've ever been.

653
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,291
Me too, Takuya.

654
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:00,083
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

655
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:01,833
Hmm.

656
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:19,041
Ai.

657
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:23,041
Can we… do it tonight?

658
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:24,500
What?

659
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,875
-I don't…
-I'll be gentle.

660
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:30,750
-Trust me.
-Huh? Wait, hold on.

661
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:31,916
No, wait.

662
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,208
-Takuya…
-It'll be fine.

663
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,166
Stop.

664
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,416
-It didn't work last time, remember?
-It's fine.

665
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,750
-Don't worry.
-It won't go in!

666
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,833
Ow! It hurts!

667
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,958
I'm sorry.

668
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,333
Well, that kinda

669
00:51:58,083 --> 00:51:59,416
killed the mood, huh?

670
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,291
It is what it is.

671
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:13,333
You are

672
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,875
who you are, Ai.

673
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,166
I'm going to sleep.

674
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,041
-Good work today.
-You too.

675
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,500
You should go home.

676
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,458
Uh-huh.

677
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,916
What's wrong?

678
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:48,333
Dr. Wada.

679
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,166
Can you make me a woman?

680
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,750
A woman?

681
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,916
Oh, no, no, no.

682
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,166
I don't have
that kind of relationship with her.

683
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,416
Ai?

684
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,333
It's not that simple.

685
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:16,208
This is much more difficult compared
to just removing testicles.

686
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:21,333
You have to cut and invert the penis,
then create a vagina.

687
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,500
You don't just remove it.

688
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:27,500
You have to maintain
the excretory functions.

689
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,041
And the vagina needs
to withstand intercourse.

690
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,791
It's like we're playing God here.

691
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:37,916
And…

692
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,041
There's a chance
you might not wake from the anesthesia.

693
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,291
I wonder why I missed.

694
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:53,458
What?

695
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,583
I had a fifty percent chance,
but I missed it.

696
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:06,333
If I were born a woman,
I wouldn't feel like this.

697
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,875
I wanna gamble not waking up.

698
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:26,750
Just make me the woman I am.

699
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:31,916
Even if I might die.

700
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,208
DOCTORS WHO PERFORMED
SEX CHANGE SURGERY

701
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:41,166
IN VIOLATION OF
THE EUGENIC PREVENTION LAW

702
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,708
ARE TRANSSEXUAL ALLIES CRIMINALS?

703
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:52,750
FOUND GUILTY OF PERFORMING
SEX REASSIGNMENT SURGERY

704
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,500
Excuse me, Doctor.

705
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:01,416
What do you plan to do?

706
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,000
Wow.

707
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,750
If you perform the surgery,
you might lose your license.

708
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,458
You might even get arrested.

709
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:21,875
I want to do it for her if I can.

710
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:27,666
I don't have the confidence yet.

711
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:31,541
I don't know if I'm capable.

712
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:11,458
It's all coming To me now

713
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:17,541
I am a new me

714
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:25,250
As the vessel rushes on

715
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:31,541
The white waves dance in its wake

716
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:38,208
I made a promise with you

717
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:39,833
And I'm gonna keep it…

718
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:42,083
I'll place the urethra inside.

719
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,666
Natural lubrication could be possible.

720
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:51,833
The flower Of love in my heart

721
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:57,916
Will be accepted by you

722
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:05,583
The blue sky where the swallows fly

723
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:11,083
Is a canvas
For our dreams of the future

724
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:18,583
Free lines, free colors

725
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:24,916
We'll paint it together

726
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:36,250
I was…

727
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,250
scared.

728
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:43,500
Why?

729
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:47,541
If I do operate,

730
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,916
you might die in the middle of surgery.

731
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:00,541
But I realized something.

732
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:07,041
You might live
your whole life in a man's body.

733
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,291
And being trapped in that body could
someday kill both your heart and soul.

734
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:27,958
I could possibly save you from that.

735
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:38,458
But I have to gather up the courage.

736
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,791
I have to ensure it will be
a successful outcome.

737
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:48,833
Ai…

738
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,250
I'll…

739
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:58,333
I'll do it.

740
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,958
Doctor…

741
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:12,166
Let me save… your life…

742
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:18,875
your soul… and your heart.

743
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:25,083
I'd be honored to do it.

744
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,083
Thank you.

745
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:43,500
Hmm.

746
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,833
Thank you so much.

747
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:53,041
Are you okay Kenji?

748
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,625
You don't usually call.

749
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,291
Mom, you know that I…

750
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:02,958
What is it?

751
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,708
I uh…

752
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,208
I…forgot.

753
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:18,666
I can't remember what I wanted to say.

754
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,500
What's with you?

755
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:23,208
Is this a prank?

756
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:25,208
It's a prank call, you're right.

757
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:40,708
I'm hanging up now.

758
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:43,208
My kinpira will burn.

759
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,750
I love your kinpira.

760
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,000
I really do.

761
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,125
Make me some later?

762
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,541
It's just thrown together.

763
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:58,750
You really have no sense of taste.

764
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:03,125
I'm hanging up.

765
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:30,625
It's almost time.

766
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,541
Do you have any doubts?

767
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,416
Of course. A lot.

768
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:46,666
Ai… you were born in a man's body.

769
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,625
God just made a small mistake.

770
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:55,708
I'm going to fix that for you.

771
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:00,625
When you wake up,

772
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:03,625
you will finally be your true self.

773
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,791
Hey, Doctor.

774
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,000
Yes?

775
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:15,208
I want…

776
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:21,208
I wanna go back in time
to tell my past self this…

777
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,833
"Everything is going to be okay."

778
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:31,750
"One day, you will become a woman. "

779
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:39,583
Okay. You ready?

780
01:03:54,166 --> 01:04:00,791
I got a new

781
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:06,416
Hairdo

782
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:16,208
You say I look so different

783
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:25,916
You're looking…

784
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,083
Pretty bashful

785
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:41,791
As you walk past me

786
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:59,750
Show us!

787
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:01,958
Shut up and die!

788
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:35,333
It's the man-woman!

789
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:37,041
So weird!

790
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:48,250
Hey, Kenji…

791
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:23,875
Ai. It feels so good.

792
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:25,833
Takuya…

793
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:41,625
You were great.

794
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:43,958
You're really a woman.

795
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:49,208
What's wrong?

796
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:52,041
Tears of joy?

797
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:55,041
They're not.

798
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:57,416
Huh? They're not?

799
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:00,583
Did it hurt that bad?

800
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:06,500
Maybe I'm jealous.

801
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,583
Jealous?

802
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:15,166
What are you jealous of?

803
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,333
-Because, Takuya…
-Yeah?

804
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,416
You looked like
you were really feeling good.

805
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:30,791
It made me think, "He wants a girl."

806
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,625
"He prefers women's bodies."

807
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,291
I wondered

808
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:43,541
what if you actually didn't like me
in my body before?

809
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,333
Ai, no way!

810
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:48,875
-Get that out of your head.
-I know it's stupid.

811
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,125
But I can't help…

812
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:57,291
I can't help it if I'm jealous.

813
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,958
Women are very lucky.

814
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:10,083
They have bodies that men love
without doing anything special.

815
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:17,666
Hey.

816
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:25,125
Hey, Ai. Did you not enjoy it…
'cause you're a woman?

817
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:27,333
You idiot.

818
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:32,000
I'm really happy now.

819
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:33,458
That's how I feel.

820
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:38,416
I'm really happy too…
being with the real you, Ai.

821
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,750
Takuya…

822
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:54,291
Vitals?

823
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:59,750
Pulse is 80, blood pressure
of 126-over-73 and breathing is stable.

824
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:00,791
Let's begin.

825
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,291
-Scalpel.
-Scalpel.

826
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:27,083
I have performed
many sex change operations,

827
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:31,125
but I believe that preventing adhesions
after surgery is a major issue.

828
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:33,916
For example, in Thailand,

829
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,416
they form a hard candle
and insert it into the vagina,

830
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,291
but it has little effect
and is a burden on the patient.

831
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:44,041
In order to protect the patients' bodies,

832
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:47,041
I would like to use
your silicone manufacturing technology.

833
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:49,416
I ask for your cooperation
in the joint development

834
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,625
of a dilator to prevent
the vagina from closing.

835
01:09:52,541 --> 01:09:55,875
I believe that this is the key
to opening this field's advancement.

836
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:59,250
Thank you all for your consideration.

837
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,875
Hey, my mom and dad are happy.

838
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:19,666
They've been bugging me
to let them meet you, you know.

839
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,833
-Are you sure they want me there?
-Yeah. They'll be glad I brought you.

840
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:25,083
I mean, it's not gonna be
formal or anything.

841
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:27,750
-Hmm.
-Relatives will be there with their kids.

842
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,125
That's when I was a kid!

843
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:35,666
Takuya's always been
such a sensitive crybaby, hasn't he?

844
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,416
I wouldn't have guessed that.
He hasn't shown me that side.

845
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,750
Come on. That's enough of that.

846
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,666
Oh yeah. I have plans with my friends.

847
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:44,708
-Hmm?
-I'll be back.

848
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:46,791
-Mm-hmm.
-You can chill here.

849
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:47,958
-Be safe.
-Careful.

850
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:50,791
-All right, all right. See you later.
-Bye-bye!

851
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:52,125
Bye.

852
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,375
This is delicious.

853
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:59,250
Oh-ho-ho! Thank you.

854
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:00,583
It's time.

855
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:08,708
You kids, go play outside for a bit.

856
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:10,833
Okay!

857
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:12,500
All right, let's go.

858
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:13,750
All right.

859
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:28,750
It's just…

860
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,375
Please, Ai…

861
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,583
break up with Takuya.

862
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:39,541
What?

863
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:42,958
You're wonderful.
You're a really good person.

864
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:44,875
I love who you are.

865
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,541
You're beautiful and kind.

866
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:50,750
Except… you can't have children.

867
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,250
Sorry about this.

868
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:59,541
Takuya… loves children.

869
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:04,000
But if you and Takuya get married one day…

870
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:07,291
he'll have one less reason to smile.

871
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:11,083
I'm sorry.

872
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:18,875
Please, Ai.

873
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:33,916
-With handcuffs.
-Where'd this happen?

874
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,541
-His sister's house.
-Is her house a police station?

875
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:38,833
You said that, queen!

876
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:56,708
What's wrong?

877
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:58,083
Is it Takuya?

878
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:07,500
Can't hide anything from you, Aki.

879
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,583
Okama eyes are omnipresent you know.

880
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,666
What's going on?

881
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:16,958
I'll be fine.

882
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:22,000
This is something I have to do on my own.

883
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:25,875
Okay.

884
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:29,500
-Right? I said that!
-You said that.

885
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,791
I want to make out! Long! Yeah!

886
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,708
Maybe you should call--

887
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:46,583
Ai speaking.

888
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:16,625
Kenji.

889
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:18,083
Where's Grandma?

890
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,333
She's in her room.

891
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:49,333
Kenji.

892
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:00,083
Grandma?

893
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:14,458
Grandma.

894
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:22,625
Grandma…

895
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:34,916
Grandma…

896
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:39,208
always asked how you were doing.

897
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:41,250
Oh, really?

898
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,625
Yeah, she really did.

899
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,625
She used to say this one thing.

900
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,416
What did she say?

901
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,208
That you were strong.

902
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:00,041
SEIKO MATSUDA
IDOL BOOK

903
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:03,458
And that you should always live
your life the way you want to.

904
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,625
-Hey. What does that mean?
-Takuya, I just told you everything.

905
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:37,916
Why are you packing?

906
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,500
-You didn't tell me everything--
-I'm packing because we're done.

907
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:41,666
I'm going to Tokyo.

908
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:44,250
Hold on! What? Hey, wait!

909
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:47,458
Ai… Do you not love me anymore or what?

910
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:48,666
Takuya.

911
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:51,833
What we had was an immature mistake.

912
01:16:51,916 --> 01:16:53,291
An immature mistake?

913
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:55,875
Goodbye.

914
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:58,041
Ai, wait! Hey!

915
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,833
You're just gonna leave like this?

916
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:25,333
When I'm all alone

917
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:32,125
I listen to my favorite song

918
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:39,000
Because Olivia

919
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:46,083
Comforts my lonely heart

920
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:52,541
My cup of jasmine tea

921
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:58,958
This sedative, lulling me to sleep

922
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:05,666
I want my day to end

923
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:13,166
The way I want it to tonight

924
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:16,833
When we first met

925
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:20,208
Never could I have imagined

926
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:25,583
A day like this would come

927
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:30,375
Making good things better

928
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:33,750
No, it's already done

929
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:40,375
It's just that time has passed

930
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:47,166
You are exhausted from loving

931
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:54,166
A phantom version of me

932
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:04,708
1998 TOKYO

933
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:14,750
I'll work very hard. I'll do anything!

934
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:16,833
You were a man before?

935
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,583
You're not right for our agency.

936
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:21,791
I can sing and I can dance.

937
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:25,375
We would welcome you,
but you're not a woman.

938
01:19:26,916 --> 01:19:27,833
Mm.

939
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:30,166
You'll never find anyone more motivated.

940
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,833
I like you a lot.

941
01:19:32,916 --> 01:19:34,583
I'll introduce you to a good agency.

942
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:36,750
-Amazing!
-Mm-hmm!

943
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:40,000
A sexy place.
They eat up cuties like you there.

944
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:41,625
What?

945
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:44,708
There's plenty of customers
with unique tastes. Hmm.

946
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:54,791
Really? That's great news!

947
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,416
I'm still asking around, though.

948
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:02,250
If it all works out, I can help
people like you for much cheaper.

949
01:20:03,791 --> 01:20:06,708
Awesome. You're doing so good.

950
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:09,458
What've you been up to?

951
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,375
How's Tokyo treating you?

952
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:15,583
It's treating me well.
I've been getting so many jobs.

953
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:18,000
People in Tokyo don't scare me at all.

954
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,666
That's good to hear.

955
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:23,375
Oh, they need me. Sorry.

956
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:25,541
No worries. We'll talk soon.

957
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,208
Bye.

958
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:37,666
I'm not getting any jobs.

959
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:45,250
Who is it?

960
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:52,541
Who is it? A prank?

961
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,208
Mom?

962
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:05,250
Thank you.

963
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,833
I'm surprised to see you.

964
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,458
We're divorcing.

965
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,666
Your dad was cheating.

966
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,083
He was?

967
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:34,541
I couldn't take it anymore, so I left.

968
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,916
I've been reflecting on a lot of things.

969
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,833
Even though your dad
should be the one doing that.

970
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:49,708
Are you… just here to tell me that?

971
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:52,250
You're our child.

972
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,250
I think you can understand.

973
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:00,916
You know how I feel

974
01:22:02,041 --> 01:22:03,250
as a woman.

975
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:09,541
What?

976
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:23,166
You… you always… were a woman, yes?

977
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:30,875
You don't have to hide it from me.
Not anymore.

978
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:43,833
I'm sorry.

979
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:47,625
I gave birth to you like that.

980
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,625
In the wrong body.

981
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:51,583
What are you saying?

982
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:53,666
Mom, it's not your fault.

983
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:57,375
All parents are responsible
for their kids.

984
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:06,625
When your grandma passed away,
my heart was crushed when I saw you.

985
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:11,208
You tried so hard
to dress up like a man in that suit.

986
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:15,416
You tried so hard to kill
your true self for so long.

987
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,333
I realized that I was the one
who made you feel that way.

988
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:23,833
But I couldn't deal with it.

989
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,250
That's why…

990
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:30,541
I couldn't be around you at all.

991
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:36,875
I did that a lot actually.

992
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:40,916
I'd been turning away from you
since you were little.

993
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:46,583
Have you always known?

994
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:50,541
I'm your mother. Of course I did.

995
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:56,625
All this time…

996
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:02,000
I thought you hated everything about me.

997
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:04,333
Of course not.

998
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,291
I even went to your apartment.

999
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:13,000
I wanted… to talk about everything.

1000
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:16,333
I wanted to face you properly.

1001
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:22,333
-Who's that?
-You don't have to answer that.

1002
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:23,958
Yes, I do.

1003
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,875
Coming!

1004
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,166
Hello?

1005
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,958
Who is it?

1006
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:37,333
-A ding-dong ditch?
-Maybe a neighbor.

1007
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:40,333
-We were loud, you know.
-It's fine. Come on.

1008
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:42,791
-Come on and do what?
-Make out!

1009
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:51,291
I couldn't give this to you then.

1010
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:53,458
I know it's your favorite.

1011
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:12,041
I'm sorry I was such a… awful mother.

1012
01:25:14,875 --> 01:25:16,041
I'm sorry.

1013
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,875
Why are you sorry?

1014
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:23,916
I'm the one who should…

1015
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,875
who should be sorry.

1016
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:32,708
I…

1017
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:41,416
You went through so much
to give birth to my body and I--

1018
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,166
Don't apologize.

1019
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:46,833
Whether you're a man… or a woman,

1020
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:50,000
you will always be my child.

1021
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:55,041
My beautiful, precious child.

1022
01:25:58,208 --> 01:26:00,083
Mom…

1023
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:24,958
Do me a favor, will you, Ai?

1024
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:27,791
It's a nostalgic pain…

1025
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:30,708
What is it?

1026
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:35,291
You called me… "Ai."

1027
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,166
You didn't call me… "Kenji."

1028
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:50,375
Will you… do my makeup?

1029
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,041
Makeup?

1030
01:26:54,041 --> 01:27:00,875
Yes, Ai. I came to see you…
when you performed at the club.

1031
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:02,541
You did?

1032
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,708
Yes, I did.

1033
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:08,916
You were so cute in your makeup.

1034
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:12,666
I am so proud of you.

1035
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,125
I admired you.

1036
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:25,125
Ai, I think that you're beautiful.

1037
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:30,041
Why must the dreams Lost to time

1038
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:37,125
Always appear so beautiful?

1039
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:39,708
That affection

1040
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:44,791
Of the past is still

1041
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:50,708
A sweet memory

1042
01:27:50,791 --> 01:27:54,250
Sweet memories

1043
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:02,875
The files for tomorrow's counseling.

1044
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:04,250
Oh. Thank you.

1045
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,791
Doctor, aren't you tired?

1046
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,291
You must be too.

1047
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:09,958
Oh, I'm sorry, we're--

1048
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:13,000
It seems like you're going all out
with this thing, huh?

1049
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:15,208
What do you mean?

1050
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:18,875
With all those okama.

1051
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,708
Listen, if you just mess
with them a little, it's not a big deal.

1052
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:28,333
You're doing too much.

1053
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:31,750
How many dicks
have you cut off this month, huh?

1054
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:36,333
-Please be careful with your words.
-Apologies.

1055
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:37,458
It slipped.

1056
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:41,541
As far as we are concerned, Wada,

1057
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:43,625
we're not going to drop this.

1058
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:47,500
This is a legitimate medical procedure
to save our patients.

1059
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:50,458
That's not something that's
up to you to decide.

1060
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:53,583
It's up to the state.

1061
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:02,958
What?! You used to be a man?

1062
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:09,166
Don't you think that maybe it would be
better to hide that in this business?

1063
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:13,583
I want to be an idol.
And I want to do things honestly.

1064
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:15,166
Mm-hmm.

1065
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:17,916
I like your spunk.
We're happy to bring you on.

1066
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,708
Mark my words. You'll be working a lot!

1067
01:29:20,791 --> 01:29:23,958
Thank you very much!

1068
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:27,625
Oh, how cute!

1069
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:33,333
Hi, all!

1070
01:29:33,416 --> 01:29:36,166
I just love seeing
every one of you here today!

1071
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:37,458
I'll introduce myself.

1072
01:29:37,541 --> 01:29:39,875
I'm Ai, and I'm here from Osaka,
now in Tokyo.

1073
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,625
And I'm doing my best!

1074
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:45,958
MATSUZAKAYA
FREE CHARITY MUSIC FESTIVAL

1075
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:02,083
I wanna do something fun!

1076
01:30:03,166 --> 01:30:04,541
What is this?!

1077
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:06,333
I'm not wearing this.

1078
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:09,875
I don't know what to tell you.

1079
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:11,625
I cleared it with your agency.

1080
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,375
An okama doesn't get embarrassed.
Just wear it.

1081
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:17,708
BOYS OVER BALLS

1082
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,375
It's taking forever.

1083
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,416
What the hell am I?

1084
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:44,083
Doctor, I need you. Doctor!

1085
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:47,666
What's wrong?

1086
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:49,583
Doctor! It's a code blue!

1087
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:51,083
Step aside.

1088
01:30:51,166 --> 01:30:54,250
-Open the IV. Defib. Epinephrine.
-Can you hear me? I'm here.

1089
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:55,208
Okay!

1090
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:58,291
Can you hear me? I don't feel a pulse.

1091
01:30:59,916 --> 01:31:03,125
-Is the defib ready yet?
-Almost! I'm starting the ambu bag.

1092
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:27,041
Can you explain all of this?

1093
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:32,791
Medical terms are so difficult
to understand for the average person.

1094
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:34,458
I don't get 'em.

1095
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:42,708
Tell me why…
an okama you were operating on

1096
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:46,625
suddenly died during a procedure
you perform a lot?

1097
01:31:48,708 --> 01:31:51,583
We haven't determined
the cause of death quite yet.

1098
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,458
Oh…

1099
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,416
If I had to guess,

1100
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:04,166
it was a complication called
ARDS from the anesthesia.

1101
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:08,083
The cause of ARDS is often unknown,
so there's no way to prevent it.

1102
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:12,375
Wada… are you telling me
that it's not your fault?

1103
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:20,958
What I'm telling you is that
that is my best guess.

1104
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,666
As of now, that's the best I can do
for my deceased patient.

1105
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:29,625
Interesting.

1106
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:34,750
Very interesting.

1107
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:37,125
By the way, doctor,

1108
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:42,375
I've been… wondering about something.

1109
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:47,541
Why would you befriend those people?

1110
01:32:49,833 --> 01:32:52,708
Are you into that sort of thing too?

1111
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:57,000
Or maybe…

1112
01:33:00,291 --> 01:33:02,791
You get your rocks off
with this kind of stuff, hmm?

1113
01:33:04,416 --> 01:33:07,000
You like cutting off men's dicks?

1114
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:15,291
Not speaking now?

1115
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:18,625
I've got all day for this.

1116
01:33:23,916 --> 01:33:24,791
ANGEL NEST

1117
01:33:24,875 --> 01:33:28,000
Sangen-jaya? Wow. Isn't that expensive?

1118
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:30,583
I heard it's great there.
There's a lot of them.

1119
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:33,250
So it's different from where you live!

1120
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:35,958
I mean it. What are you laughing about?

1121
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:40,750
By the way, Ai, this place is nice.
It's really cute here, I like it.

1122
01:33:40,833 --> 01:33:43,750
I was asked to work here.

1123
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:46,500
I'm only part-time
because I'm busy in entertainment.

1124
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:48,791
That's good. Things are going well.

1125
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:51,333
Tokyo has been really great.

1126
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:52,708
All right.

1127
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,208
I have something
I want to show you, Ai.

1128
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:56,666
-Hmm?
-It's this.

1129
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:58,666
-Ah.
-Go ahead. Look.

1130
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:07,541
-Miss International… Queen?
-Yep. Uh-huh.

1131
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:11,041
They decide who's the most beautiful
trans woman in the world.

1132
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:13,333
Ai. You're adorable. You should enter.

1133
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:14,500
-Right?
-She Should!

1134
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:18,208
-I'm interested, but I'm kinda busy.
-Then I'll enter!

1135
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:21,833
-I will represent Japan!
-No, please. You can't!

1136
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:23,333
Japan will sink.

1137
01:34:23,416 --> 01:34:25,583
Hey girl, what did you just say to me?!

1138
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:27,291
You said that, queen!

1139
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:29,375
Not again! She's been saying that forever.

1140
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,375
Ai, did you hear about Dr. Wada?

1141
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:34,708
Hear what?

1142
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:37,958
Someone died during one of his operations.

1143
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:39,500
Are you serious?

1144
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:42,750
People have been saying
it wasn't Dr. Wada's fault,

1145
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:43,916
so it should be fine.

1146
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,291
Mm-hmm.

1147
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:48,625
-Girl, your bubbles are flat.
-You made them flat!

1148
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:49,541
Oh, no.

1149
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:52,041
-He's here!
-Dr. Wada's here!

1150
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:53,833
Dr. Wada!

1151
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:58,833
What do you think
about sex change surgery?

1152
01:34:58,916 --> 01:35:01,250
We need to know!
People need to know about it!

1153
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:03,333
-Dr. Wada!
-Excuse me.

1154
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:08,250
Are you okay?

1155
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,583
Yeah.

1156
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,416
Who knows when we'll open
with all this going on.

1157
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,875
Doctor, here.

1158
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:18,208
-What?
-The list of patients who want surgery.

1159
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:20,833
It's increased
since the beginning of this month.

1160
01:35:22,833 --> 01:35:24,333
This many?

1161
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:25,958
Yes.

1162
01:35:38,791 --> 01:35:39,875
THANK YOU, DR. WADA

1163
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:41,958
I'M GOING TO SHINE BRIGHT
FROM AI

1164
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:54,958
Is everyone well?

1165
01:35:57,708 --> 01:36:01,333
You are? I wonder why.

1166
01:36:01,416 --> 01:36:04,125
Hey, guess what?

1167
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:07,416
That's right. I finally made it to Nagoya.

1168
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,000
Thank you.

1169
01:36:11,916 --> 01:36:17,125
I go on tour each and every summer,

1170
01:36:17,208 --> 01:36:23,750
but I was a little late this year,
and now we're in chilly November.

1171
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:28,083
It's so cold, so, like, the only thing
to do now is to warm ourselves back up.

1172
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:31,000
-Isn't that right?
-Hey there.

1173
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:33,875
-Ah! Sorry about that!
-It's been a while.

1174
01:36:33,958 --> 01:36:36,791
Aw, I'm so happy you came!

1175
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,125
So am I.
What were you lip-synching for?

1176
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:41,666
Were you practicing? Kyon Kyon, huh?

1177
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,625
-Yeah.
-You remembered it perfectly.

1178
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:45,958
I memorized it because
it was on every day.

1179
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:48,250
Wow, you memorized it like a pro.

1180
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:52,583
Oh! You should do it as a bit.
It'd be funny if you did other people too.

1181
01:36:52,666 --> 01:36:53,583
Who, me?

1182
01:36:53,666 --> 01:36:55,916
It'd be funny. I'd laugh.

1183
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,166
Oh! You're gonna be an idol,
so you don't need to be funny or anything.

1184
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:02,583
Sorry if I said
something unnecessary. I forgot.

1185
01:37:02,666 --> 01:37:05,083
Hmm. What should I have?

1186
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:10,333
Now then. Shall we get started today?

1187
01:37:20,416 --> 01:37:21,541
What is it?

1188
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:29,166
This time would be
better used for surgeries.

1189
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:35,916
You just want
to make me the bad guy, don't you?

1190
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:39,250
Without even proper investigation,

1191
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:42,333
you're trying to make the cause of death
an overdose of anesthesia

1192
01:37:42,416 --> 01:37:44,125
because it's the most obvious.

1193
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:47,291
I'm really shocked.

1194
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:51,541
Do you actually think of us that way?

1195
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:54,791
You know what?

1196
01:37:56,291 --> 01:37:58,041
I've finally realized something.

1197
01:37:58,125 --> 01:37:59,291
Go on.

1198
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:04,291
It's not doctors who save patients.

1199
01:38:05,166 --> 01:38:06,458
It's the opposite.

1200
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:12,541
Doctors are being kept alive by the power
of the patients' desire to live.

1201
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,625
Right.

1202
01:38:15,875 --> 01:38:17,583
As a way to say thanks,

1203
01:38:19,416 --> 01:38:22,416
we take our jobs seriously
and try to reduce patients' suffering,

1204
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,875
even if only a little.

1205
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:28,375
Simply curing illnesses and injuries
isn't what saves them from suffering.

1206
01:38:28,458 --> 01:38:30,583
It's something
far more important than that.

1207
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:32,958
Doctors face each and every patient

1208
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:35,458
and do our best
to support them in every way!

1209
01:38:35,541 --> 01:38:38,583
That's the sole reason
doctors exist as a profession!

1210
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:49,333
Doctors and medical care…
have always existed

1211
01:38:49,416 --> 01:38:51,375
since the birth of humanity.

1212
01:38:52,666 --> 01:38:55,083
Long before countries and laws
came to be created.

1213
01:38:57,541 --> 01:39:00,750
And that is exactly why we will
always be the winners in the end.

1214
01:39:29,083 --> 01:39:31,416
It's impossible.

1215
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:34,833
I can't become an idol.

1216
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:42,666
But I really wanted it.

1217
01:39:52,208 --> 01:39:53,250
Doctor.

1218
01:39:57,375 --> 01:39:59,208
I had some business in Tokyo.

1219
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:04,333
Are you all right?

1220
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,875
The clinic had an accident.

1221
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:11,166
Hmm.

1222
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:13,708
How about you?

1223
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:16,500
Are you doing okay?

1224
01:40:16,583 --> 01:40:20,041
Of course I am. Everything's amazing.

1225
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:25,416
That's great.

1226
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:29,458
You made the right decision.

1227
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:36,541
You're shining in Tokyo, too, then.

1228
01:40:43,416 --> 01:40:45,250
I'm not shining at all.

1229
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:53,000
I think my light may have burned out.

1230
01:40:57,708 --> 01:40:59,458
I've been struggling…

1231
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:03,583
since I came to Tokyo.

1232
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:13,166
What am I doing with my life?

1233
01:41:18,166 --> 01:41:19,333
You know, Ai…

1234
01:41:21,333 --> 01:41:23,375
you're the one who led me on my path.

1235
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:29,125
The orchiectomy.

1236
01:41:30,416 --> 01:41:32,166
The sex change surgery.

1237
01:41:35,541 --> 01:41:38,333
I'm on my path
because you shined your light on it.

1238
01:41:47,708 --> 01:41:48,666
Although…

1239
01:41:52,875 --> 01:41:55,000
your path has only led you here.

1240
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:03,250
You know, I…

1241
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:07,708
I caused the death…

1242
01:42:10,125 --> 01:42:11,833
of a precious patient

1243
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:14,958
who put their trust in me.

1244
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:26,583
Were we doing the right thing?
Or the wrong thing?

1245
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:36,833
The right thing Doctor! Absolutely!

1246
01:42:39,208 --> 01:42:40,708
None of it was wrong.

1247
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:43,375
Neither of us made any mistakes!

1248
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:48,333
You have to keep going, Doctor.

1249
01:42:48,416 --> 01:42:50,166
I can still do more.

1250
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:53,291
I'm gonna do
more and more and more until I die!

1251
01:42:56,916 --> 01:42:58,166
We can shine.

1252
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:14,250
I'm leaving.

1253
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,875
I'm sorry for getting sentimental.

1254
01:43:30,291 --> 01:43:32,875
I've decided to resume
the surgeries tomorrow.

1255
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:37,083
That's why I wanted to see you.

1256
01:43:44,583 --> 01:43:45,500
Bye.

1257
01:43:58,458 --> 01:43:59,625
It's over there.

1258
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:02,250
Here.

1259
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:12,125
-Clip it.
-Okay.

1260
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,833
I still have a long way to go.

1261
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:19,666
So if you look from the side like this,

1262
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:23,750
you can see
how they built things up one by one.

1263
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:24,833
Like this.

1264
01:44:24,916 --> 01:44:29,416
And, you know,
all those people are standing tall,

1265
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:32,041
And they are so amazing, and well,

1266
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:38,291
what I'm doing is just placing
some things somewhere out on the ground.

1267
01:44:38,375 --> 01:44:41,708
It's so low,
you can't see the shape of it.

1268
01:44:41,791 --> 01:44:45,750
And you might start to wonder
what I'm doing. But…

1269
01:44:55,166 --> 01:44:56,916
"NEWHALF" FOUND DECEASED

1270
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,083
IN A BOTCHED UNDERGROUND
SEX CHANGE SURGERY

1271
01:45:16,416 --> 01:45:18,125
-Let's do it.
-Let's go home.

1272
01:45:18,208 --> 01:45:20,041
You're just stressed
because you're left-handed.

1273
01:45:20,125 --> 01:45:21,583
"Because you're left-handed?"

1274
01:45:21,666 --> 01:45:23,916
My right elbow is stressing you out?

1275
01:45:26,416 --> 01:45:28,250
-Who's gonna die? Not me.
-Scary.

1276
01:45:28,333 --> 01:45:29,666
Yeah, you.

1277
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:31,750
-Ah!
-I'm not scared of whatever you're--

1278
01:45:31,833 --> 01:45:34,583
Hi, may I help you?

1279
01:45:34,666 --> 01:45:37,166
Hey, who is this?
What? You're on your way here?

1280
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:39,333
-What? What?
-I'm so excited!

1281
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:43,500
Yes! I can't wait till you get here!

1282
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:45,833
-What are you excited about?
-Who's coming?

1283
01:45:45,916 --> 01:45:47,125
Listen up.

1284
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:50,166
Get presentable, everyone.

1285
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:52,583
A famous idol is coming here!

1286
01:45:53,458 --> 01:45:55,125
-Huh?
-What?

1287
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:57,916
I'm sure she'll be arriving
any minute now.

1288
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,708
-I don't think so. Whoa.
-Who is she?

1289
01:46:00,791 --> 01:46:02,833
-I wasn't told. Were you?
-You're excited.

1290
01:46:02,916 --> 01:46:04,208
-Idol…
-What?

1291
01:46:11,291 --> 01:46:14,750
I can't decide! Sexy? Cute?

1292
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:16,958
Which do you prefer?

1293
01:46:17,041 --> 01:46:18,625
I can't decide!

1294
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:23,416
Because I am
A purehearted fair maiden

1295
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,958
Because I love you…

1296
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:28,750
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1297
01:46:35,541 --> 01:46:38,375
Yeah!

1298
01:46:44,333 --> 01:46:46,583
Hello, Tokyo.

1299
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:49,000
It is I. Aya Matsuura!

1300
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:51,083
-She's Ayaya!
-I got it, I got it.

1301
01:46:51,166 --> 01:46:52,250
The idol, yeah.

1302
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:53,875
This morning…

1303
01:46:54,916 --> 01:46:56,250
I think…

1304
01:46:57,250 --> 01:46:59,625
I woke up at 9:00.

1305
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:03,666
So I went to wash up.

1306
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:06,708
I have my toothpaste,

1307
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:09,291
and next to the toothpaste

1308
01:47:09,375 --> 01:47:11,791
is my face cleanser.

1309
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:16,416
I grabbed the tube

1310
01:47:17,208 --> 01:47:19,125
and started washing my face.

1311
01:47:20,666 --> 01:47:23,875
And I thought to myself…

1312
01:47:23,958 --> 01:47:26,458
Yo, this cleanser feels different.

1313
01:47:26,541 --> 01:47:28,250
-Her face!
-Her face is funny.

1314
01:47:28,333 --> 01:47:30,291
And that's when it dawned on me.

1315
01:47:30,375 --> 01:47:33,916
Oopsie! Wrong one.

1316
01:47:35,625 --> 01:47:40,416
"Yeah! It's a holiday!"

1317
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,500
Yeah! It's a holiday!

1318
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:46,791
That's my joyful wish this summer

1319
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:50,291
Yeah! Jump into summertime

1320
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:52,583
I wanna fall in love…

1321
01:47:53,666 --> 01:47:55,333
Yeah!

1322
01:47:58,833 --> 01:48:00,916
Ai! Ai!

1323
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,958
Come here!

1324
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:04,666
Why are you doing this
if you want to be an idol?

1325
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:06,333
-I've been thinking.
-Yeah?

1326
01:48:06,416 --> 01:48:08,833
I should only do what I can do, right?

1327
01:48:08,916 --> 01:48:10,541
That's cool, I love it.

1328
01:48:10,625 --> 01:48:15,416
It wasn't only cool, it was amazing!
Oh! Can I pitch you to my boss for a show?

1329
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,583
I think you're gonna be a sensation!

1330
01:48:17,666 --> 01:48:19,625
-Oh my God!
-I'm not lying!

1331
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:21,208
I'm for real!

1332
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:26,000
I can't decide! Sexy? Cute?

1333
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:27,708
Which do you prefer?

1334
01:48:27,791 --> 01:48:31,583
I can't decide! I wanna catch your eye

1335
01:48:31,666 --> 01:48:34,000
Because I am
A purehearted fair maiden

1336
01:48:34,083 --> 01:48:37,250
Because I love you…

1337
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,791
She's the next big thing.

1338
01:48:44,875 --> 01:48:47,458
Yes, definitely. The next big thing.

1339
01:48:49,708 --> 01:48:53,958
"Yeah! It's a holiday!"

1340
01:48:54,041 --> 01:48:57,333
Yeah! It's a holiday!

1341
01:48:57,416 --> 01:49:00,666
That's my joyful wish this summer…

1342
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:04,000
Yeah! Jump into summertime…

1343
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:07,208
-I wanna fall in love…
-She's a hit.

1344
01:49:10,375 --> 01:49:13,500
-She's hilarious. Never would've thought.
-Welcome!

1345
01:49:13,583 --> 01:49:17,708
Nice to meet you. Please welcome
our special guest today, Haruna Ai!

1346
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:20,166
Good evening. I'm Haruna Ai.

1347
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:22,833
-It's so nice to meet you all!
-Nice to meet you!

1348
01:49:22,916 --> 01:49:25,500
Wow. You are so cute.

1349
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:27,666
-Really?
-I would date you in a second.

1350
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,750
She was actually born a boy.

1351
01:49:29,833 --> 01:49:31,458
Oh, you're an okama.
Never mind then.

1352
01:49:31,541 --> 01:49:33,125
Oh, you said that!

1353
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:36,583
-You really can't tell.
-She's great.

1354
01:49:36,666 --> 01:49:38,666
If you didn't know,
you'd think she was born a woman.

1355
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:40,791
Yeah, I might just follow
a guy like you home.

1356
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:43,083
-Well, well, well.
-No, I changed my mind.

1357
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:47,000
There you go again!
You just said you liked me. He's just shy.

1358
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:51,333
There must a be a lot going on…

1359
01:50:02,416 --> 01:50:03,916
TO TENMA WEST POLICE

1360
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
OFFICIAL OPINION
WADA PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC

1361
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:10,666
REGARDING THE CAUSE OF DEATH,
IT IS MY OFFICIAL OPINION THAT…

1362
01:50:20,458 --> 01:50:22,208
I DID WHAT I COULD.

1363
01:50:22,291 --> 01:50:27,291
IF I AM TO BE TRIED FOR NOT
BEING ABLE TO SAVE A LIFE…

1364
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,083
There we go.

1365
01:51:04,916 --> 01:51:06,583
Another mess.

1366
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:09,208
Morning.

1367
01:51:09,708 --> 01:51:10,875
Time to wake up.

1368
01:51:19,041 --> 01:51:20,000
Doctor?

1369
01:51:27,583 --> 01:51:28,583
Doctor?

1370
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,041
Wow, wow, wow!

1371
01:51:34,125 --> 01:51:36,833
You know, Ai, you were amazing tonight.

1372
01:51:36,916 --> 01:51:38,666
Another huge laugh after last week.

1373
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:40,541
It's exciting.

1374
01:51:40,625 --> 01:51:43,000
Everyone is loving your act, Ai.

1375
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:44,416
Not just the audience.

1376
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,625
I think that you've won
the production's hearts as well!

1377
01:51:46,708 --> 01:51:49,458
-Yes!
-All thanks to you, Ms. Fuji, and you.

1378
01:51:49,541 --> 01:51:52,041
You're the best, Ai.
Can't wait to see what else you bring.

1379
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:54,250
-I'm looking forward to it.
-So am I.

1380
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:56,166
-Great work. See you next week!
-Thanks so much!

1381
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,833
-See you next week!
-Have a good night.

1382
01:51:57,916 --> 01:51:59,875
-Thank you!
-Thanks so much!

1383
01:52:08,708 --> 01:52:09,958
Ai speaking.

1384
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:12,958
Hello. This is Kiyomiya from Wada Clinic.

1385
01:52:13,041 --> 01:52:15,166
Hi! It's been a while.

1386
01:52:29,166 --> 01:52:33,208
DR. KOJI WADA HAS PASSED AWAY.

1387
01:52:33,291 --> 01:52:36,791
THE CLINIC IS CLOSED.

1388
01:53:03,958 --> 01:53:07,041
DR. WADA

1389
01:53:26,166 --> 01:53:27,666
My girls and I,

1390
01:53:28,958 --> 01:53:30,625
we're all in shock too.

1391
01:53:35,666 --> 01:53:38,833
Things must have been exhausting
after that incident.

1392
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:41,166
Poor guy.

1393
01:53:42,083 --> 01:53:44,750
He didn't even have
a lawyer to defend him.

1394
01:53:45,458 --> 01:53:47,666
He wanted to tell the truth himself.

1395
01:53:50,625 --> 01:53:52,416
In the end…

1396
01:53:53,125 --> 01:53:57,666
…charges were filed for what they said
was improper use of anesthesia.

1397
01:54:01,541 --> 01:54:02,916
It's unfortunate.

1398
01:54:04,166 --> 01:54:06,750
There were still
a lot of patients waiting for him.

1399
01:54:07,333 --> 01:54:10,291
So he was doing these surgeries
without even sleeping.

1400
01:54:14,958 --> 01:54:16,375
He was so tired.

1401
01:54:17,708 --> 01:54:19,541
But he couldn't sleep a wink.

1402
01:54:20,833 --> 01:54:23,125
He started using anesthesia
to fall asleep.

1403
01:54:28,791 --> 01:54:30,958
I guess he got the dosage wrong.

1404
01:54:32,541 --> 01:54:34,250
He made a lot of women cry.

1405
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:36,083
What a bad man.

1406
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:42,375
Aki.

1407
01:54:47,458 --> 01:54:50,666
Dr. Wada visited
my bar after the accident.

1408
01:54:56,583 --> 01:54:58,750
I told him that we weren't a mistake.

1409
01:55:01,458 --> 01:55:03,958
I told him
that we could shine even brighter.

1410
01:55:13,958 --> 01:55:16,250
I really wanted to show the doctor…

1411
01:55:22,333 --> 01:55:24,666
how much brighter I could shine.

1412
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:33,666
-But he already saw you shine--
-Not how I wanted!

1413
01:55:36,375 --> 01:55:38,833
This isn't all I have.

1414
01:55:45,083 --> 01:55:47,041
I don't want to stop halfway.

1415
01:55:47,125 --> 01:55:49,000
I want to go all the way.

1416
01:56:11,166 --> 01:56:13,625
I'm gonna put my all
into shining brighter.

1417
01:56:17,916 --> 01:56:20,500
Do you think Wada will know?

1418
01:56:24,625 --> 01:56:26,333
Absolutely, he will.

1419
01:56:27,250 --> 01:56:30,708
I bet his eyes'll be wide open
watching from the other side.

1420
01:56:31,208 --> 01:56:34,666
He's gonna get dry eyes. All 'cause of Ai.

1421
01:56:56,666 --> 01:56:59,375
What a wonderful evening it's been.

1422
01:56:59,458 --> 01:57:01,500
So many smiles, so much passion,

1423
01:57:01,583 --> 01:57:04,458
and incredible stories
from around the world.

1424
01:57:05,083 --> 01:57:09,416
Each one reminds us
true beauty shines in so many ways.

1425
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:12,041
-No.
-And we celebrate them all.

1426
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:14,750
-Next, representing Japan.
-We made it.

1427
01:57:14,833 --> 01:57:18,791
She lights up every heart
with her warmth and joyful spirit.

1428
01:57:18,875 --> 01:57:21,083
Please welcome Haruna Ai!

1429
01:57:40,208 --> 01:57:45,375
I got a new hairdo

1430
01:57:46,416 --> 01:57:51,458
You say I look so different

1431
01:57:52,458 --> 01:57:57,875
You're looking pretty bashful

1432
01:57:58,541 --> 01:58:03,125
As you're walking past me

1433
01:58:05,041 --> 01:58:11,125
-I wish you had told me
-Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh

1434
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:16,250
You think I look pretty

1435
01:58:17,416 --> 01:58:22,541
You're always hesitating

1436
01:58:23,541 --> 01:58:26,875
It's like you're behind a veil…

1437
01:58:26,958 --> 01:58:27,958
Ai!

1438
01:58:29,416 --> 01:58:31,791
Fresh, fresh, fresh!

1439
01:58:32,708 --> 01:58:35,541
Open up that door To summer

1440
01:58:35,625 --> 01:58:38,583
And whisk me away somewhere

1441
01:58:38,666 --> 01:58:41,250
Fresh, fresh, fresh!

1442
01:58:42,125 --> 01:58:44,500
Summer's gonna Open the door

1443
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:51,125
And take us just the way we are…

1444
02:00:54,708 --> 02:01:01,708
KOJI WADA
1953-2007

1445
02:01:08,625 --> 02:01:09,708
Doctor,

1446
02:01:10,916 --> 02:01:12,291
are you impressed?

1447
02:01:14,541 --> 02:01:16,458
I'm the best in the world.

1448
02:01:18,625 --> 02:01:20,333
But you're beyond this world.

1449
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:24,000
You'll always be
more amazing than me, though.

1450
02:01:26,166 --> 02:01:29,166
You've performed over 600 surgeries.

1451
02:01:30,166 --> 02:01:32,416
That's the most impressive thing ever.

1452
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:38,416
It all started with me, huh?

1453
02:01:40,333 --> 02:01:42,041
My operations.

1454
02:01:44,916 --> 02:01:47,083
I was your first patient for both.

1455
02:01:51,541 --> 02:01:52,583
Guess what?

1456
02:01:55,125 --> 02:01:57,375
I'll always hold that in my heart.

1457
02:02:33,583 --> 02:02:35,208
Will you watch me shine?

1458
02:02:37,083 --> 02:02:38,416
I'm gonna sing

1459
02:02:39,958 --> 02:02:41,666
and I'm gonna dance.

1460
02:02:46,041 --> 02:02:47,500
Watch me, okay?

1461
02:02:50,458 --> 02:02:52,625
This performance is for you.

1462
02:02:55,916 --> 02:02:57,583
You let me shine.

1463
02:03:04,708 --> 02:03:06,458
Thank you, Doctor.

1464
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,416
You're the reason that I…

1465
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:18,041
If I hadn't met you…

1466
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:27,666
Thank you.

1467
02:03:59,666 --> 02:04:04,416
Goodbye, sweet pain

1468
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:08,166
Those nights spent
With my chin in my hands

1469
02:04:08,958 --> 02:04:12,250
Ended yesterday

1470
02:04:14,541 --> 02:04:19,250
I want to make sure

1471
02:04:19,333 --> 02:04:23,041
That we met meant something

1472
02:04:23,791 --> 02:04:27,833
So I open my eyes in the darkness

1473
02:04:29,458 --> 02:04:32,666
Footsteps race
Along the emergency stairs

1474
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:34,625
I want them to echo

1475
02:04:34,708 --> 02:04:36,750
In a world that's fast asleep

1476
02:04:36,833 --> 02:04:40,291
A motorbike abandoned in a vacant lot

1477
02:04:40,375 --> 02:04:41,958
Graffiti on the wall

1478
02:04:42,041 --> 02:04:43,833
I look up to it all…

1479
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:46,083
Ai!

1480
02:04:46,333 --> 02:04:47,833
True grief

1481
02:04:47,916 --> 02:04:52,333
Can only be healed from within

1482
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,583
I'm beginning
To understand my revolution

1483
02:04:57,666 --> 02:05:01,208
I'm gonna shake things up for tomorrow

1484
02:05:01,291 --> 02:05:04,000
I want someone to understand

1485
02:05:04,083 --> 02:05:06,041
My tears, my dreams

1486
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:08,708
Right away

1487
02:05:08,791 --> 02:05:12,250
If you're gonna chase your dreams

1488
02:05:12,333 --> 02:05:16,166
You can't just go bursting into tears

1489
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:19,166
This is what you taught me

1490
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:21,083
My fears, my dreams

1491
02:05:21,166 --> 02:05:25,416
I set them free

1492
02:05:45,125 --> 02:05:49,750
Feel my heartache

1493
02:05:49,833 --> 02:05:54,083
I'm surrounded by smiles

1494
02:05:54,166 --> 02:05:57,958
But the lonely nights are hard

1495
02:05:59,791 --> 02:06:04,375
I want to share it

1496
02:06:04,458 --> 02:06:08,958
The words scribbled
In the margins of my textbook

1497
02:06:09,041 --> 02:06:12,875
Are coming to life…

1498
02:06:12,958 --> 02:06:14,625
