00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:45,922
How did you know who I was?

159
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:48,492
I've seen you in an article before.

160
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,822
- I have a pretty good memory.
- That's good.

161
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:54,232
Because I have
quite a few questions for you.

162
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:56,502
Back at the crime scene,

163
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,502
you told me you were
treating the victim, correct?

164
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:02,602
Yes. He was a terminal cancer patient.

165
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:06,142
By the time he came to me,
the cancer had already spread quite a bit.

166
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,712
So I...

167
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:09,672
Let's save that story for later.

168
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:11,082
What?

169
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,282
But you're the one who asked.

170
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:17,382
I was just confirming whether or not
you intended to kill him.

171
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:20,552
All right, then.
Let's go through this step-by-step.

172
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,762
What was all that stuff
in the refrigerator?

173
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:26,122
You already saw what was in there.

174
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:32,532
I'm asking you why you did it.
I want a clear explanation.

175
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,272
It's for research purposes.

176
00:15:42,612 --> 00:15:44,712
Research.

177
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,582
The dismembered bodies.

178
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:52,622
What kind of research?

179
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:57,962
You're asking because you're
actually curious, right?

180
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:01,132
- Why do you ask?
- The detectives didn't believe me.

181
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:05,732
I'll have to hear it to judge, won't I?
What was the research?

182
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,732
I was developing a cure
for incurable diseases.

183
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:11,342
Incurable diseases?

184
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:13,912
A cure that can overcome any disease.

185
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:15,512
That's the kind of cure I was making.

186
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,982
But to see if the cure actually works,

187
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:23,422
- I needed a living human body.
- So, like a clinical trial?

188
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,652
Yes. So I conducted experiments on people.

189
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,622
Did you kill them during the experiments,
or...

190
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,892
did you experiment on them
after you killed them?

191
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:41,702
Since they died
after I administered the cure...

192
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,302
No, that's not it.

193
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,842
I think I administered the cure
after I killed them.

194
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,112
It really depends on the situation.

195
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:53,882
It's case-by-case.

196
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:56,822
Fine.

197
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:00,092
That's for the autopsy to determine.

198
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:02,992
How many victims are there?

199
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:04,422
Prosecutor Cha.

200
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:08,492
How long are you going to keep asking
these pointless questions?

201
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,562
I'm telling you I was developing a cure.
Aren't you curious about that?

202
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,602
In an investigation,

203
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:17,172
the first step is to establish
the scale of the crime.

204
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,542
Now, tell me.

205
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,812
The DNA analysis suggests
there are more victims.

206
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:26,682
Where are these people?

207
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:28,382
I'm sure they're around somewhere.

208
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:29,952
Did you kill them?

209
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,422
Come on, Prosecutor Cha.

210
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,922
- You can't just keep demanding answers.
- I'm asking you, did you kill them?

211
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:39,192
- It's the same as not killing them.
- Lee Woo Gyeom!

212
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:43,402
We found more than five dismembered bodies
at the scene.

213
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:45,802
And...

214
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:49,102
they are the bodies
of the missing victims, aren't they?

215
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:03,152
Here, take a look at this.

216
00:18:11,962 --> 00:18:13,932
(17-17)

217
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,902
You know the answer, right?

218
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:20,332
Just tell me what you see.

219
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:23,702
Stop wasting my time. What's your point?

220
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:26,302
You're the one wasting time.

221
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:30,212
If we can't get on the same page,
how can this investigation get anywhere?

222
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,752
- Zero.
- Exactly.

223
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:45,422
I killed 17 people,
but in return, I saved the world.

224
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,392
So in the end, the death toll is zero.

225
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,702
It's as if I didn't kill a single person.

226
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,062
(Police)

227
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,122
Yes, Prosecutor Cha.

228
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:21,892
- We found them.
- Lee Woo Gyeom has 17 victims.

229
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:24,562
What? Seventeen victims?

230
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,932
At the crime scene of Lee Woo Gyeom,
who was arrested yesterday,

231
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:33,102
seven bodies have been discovered
out of a total of seventeen victims.

232
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:37,542
Police are determining the time of death
and identify the bodies...

233
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:41,852
Good.

234
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,622
- Min Seo.
- Dad,

235
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,092
Where have you been?

236
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:57,432
Here you go.

237
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:05,202
Let me know when you're heading out.

238
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:06,772
Okay.

239
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,392
So, Min Seo...

240
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:24,422
You love dolls that much?

241
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:27,962
- Yes.
- I know you love your dolls,

242
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,062
but it's also good to go outside...

243
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,732
- and play with your friends.
- But I don't have any friends.

244
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,802
I was only at school for a week.

245
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,502
I know.

246
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,112
It's okay, Dad.

247
00:20:44,282 --> 00:20:45,512
Min Seo,

248
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:49,112
once you're all better,
you're going to make so many friends.

249
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:53,492
Dad will send you to middle school,
high school, and...

250
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:55,852
I'll even send you abroad to study.

251
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:59,022
- Really?
- Of course I mean it.

252
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:02,492
Pinky promise? Promise.

253
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:09,002
- Dad.
- Yes?

254
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:11,242
Can't we all...

255
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:13,512
live together again...

256
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:16,042
like we used to?

257
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:21,652
Of course.

258
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:23,952
Of course we will.

259
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:44,472
(Reporter Jo Woo Cheol, Daehan Ilbo News)

260
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:48,272
Well, look who it is.
Long time no see.

261
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:51,312
(It's not too late for the Prosecution...)

262
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:52,412
(to stop the false charges and listen.)

263
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,722
Reporter Jo.

264
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:07,162
Well, hey!

265
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:13,102
- How long has it been?
- It's been way too long.

266
00:22:13,162 --> 00:22:14,872
- Have a seat.
- No, please, you have a seat.

267
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:24,342
- Here, I haven't touched this one.
- No, it's fine.

268
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:25,912
I had something on the way.

269
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,722
So, Reporter Jo.

270
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:34,592
Why did you suddenly leave the paper
when you were doing so well?

271
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:36,962
Don't get me started.

272
00:22:37,462 --> 00:22:39,992
Remember last year when I clashed
with the Prosecution?

273
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:45,002
Well, after that, I lost all my sources,
got hit with a lawsuit, and was terrified.

274
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:48,932
I still have to support my wife, right?
So I just started my own thing.

275
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,242
So, how's it working out for you?

276
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,342
Well, it's a relief not having to
walk on eggshells around the higher-ups,

277
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,512
but the money's just not there.

278
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,652
I've been following the Jeffrey case.
He's a famous producer, isn't he?

279
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:09,122
I never imagined you'd be the one
to take his case.

280
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:13,462
A man's got to feed his family.

281
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:17,532
So here I am.

282
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,132
So, Mr. Park.

283
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:22,202
How about you and I...

284
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:24,602
work on something
that'll help us both get by?

285
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,472
A case?

286
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,182
You've seen the news
about Lee Woo Gyeom, right?

287
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:37,482
The serial killer who murdered 17 people?
He wants to hire you.

288
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,752
The retainer has nine zeroes.

289
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:47,562
Man, for that kind of money,
he could hire a big-name law firm.

290
00:23:47,632 --> 00:23:49,292
He'd have a much better shot
with them than with me.

291
00:23:50,032 --> 00:23:53,972
We can't have that.
I'm the one connecting you to him,

292
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:56,072
so I need to get my finder's fee.

293
00:23:56,832 --> 00:23:57,872
Just kidding.

294
00:23:58,472 --> 00:23:59,772
Apparently, Lee Woo Gyeom has a reason...

295
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,872
why it absolutely has to be you.

296
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:05,012
And what reason is that?

297
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,082
He said you'd know what it's about
if I mentioned Moon Se Guk.

298
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:15,652
I can get you the treatment
for Batten disease.

299
00:24:16,092 --> 00:24:17,962
It's just that the procedure
is incredibly complicated.

300
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,732
He knows Moon Se Guk?

301
00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:28,132
Yes. I heard it
from Lee Woo Gyeom himself.

302
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:33,942
How in the world does he know Moon Se Guk?

303
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:36,442
He said Moon Se Guk
was one of his victims.

304
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:43,082
He killed him? Lee Woo Gyeom did?

305
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,522
- Sir, did you call for a driver? Sir.
- Seriously.

306
00:24:47,592 --> 00:24:50,022
But why would Lee Woo Gyeom
kill Moon Se Guk?

307
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:58,962
He wouldn't tell me the details.

308
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:04,472
Damn it.

309
00:25:09,472 --> 00:25:12,212
Arrange a meeting for me with him.

310
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:24,062
Section Chief Bang, get all the case files
on Lee Woo Gyeom from Detective Gong.

311
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:27,132
But I heard they'll pick which department
gets that case after the meeting today.

312
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,892
Exactly. And after that meeting,
it's going to be ours.

313
00:25:33,872 --> 00:25:34,932
What was that?

314
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,742
I told you yesterday
I was going to land this case.

315
00:25:39,742 --> 00:25:41,572
I meant that I understood.

316
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:51,722
Manager Lee, schedule an interrogation
with Lee Woo Gyeom for this afternoon.

317
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:53,082
Yes, right away.

318
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,422
- Prosecutor Cha.
- Yes?

319
00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:00,892
He has a meeting scheduled
with his attorney this afternoon.

320
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:03,832
His attorney?

321
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,002
Yes, come on in.

322
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,472
I was just heading out. Let's go.

323
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:17,682
I need to talk to you before the meeting.

324
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:20,182
All right, have a seat.

325
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:31,822
About the Lee Woo Gyeom case...

326
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:33,622
Please assign it to me.

327
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,492
What's the big rush?

328
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,002
I did all the legwork
to bring this case in myself.

329
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:43,842
I spent my whole paycheck schmoozing
the detectives at Guam Police Station.

330
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:47,312
Give me a break.
Since when you worry about money?

331
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:49,372
I know you missed the promotion,

332
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,142
and that's why
you're acting like this, but...

333
00:26:52,142 --> 00:26:56,112
Prosecutor Cha, don't focus on cases,
but your peer reviews.

334
00:26:56,712 --> 00:26:59,852
Those reviews aren't because
I did something wrong.

335
00:27:00,622 --> 00:27:03,292
I know. They're all just jealous.

336
00:27:03,862 --> 00:27:07,162
Some crazy kid just walks away
from her dad's perfectly good company,

337
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:10,832
rejects a match with a conglomerate heir,
and doesn't care what her superiors think.

338
00:27:11,202 --> 00:27:12,802
You live your life saying
whatever is on your mind.

339
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:14,172
How could they not be jealous?

340
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:17,972
That's exactly why I should take it.
I have no conflicts, so I would be clean.

341
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:19,342
No.

342
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:21,572
If only for the media attention,

343
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:23,442
it has to be someone with
Prosecutor Kim's experience.

344
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:26,382
Even with Park Han Jun
as the defense attorney?

345
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,712
What?

346
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:32,582
- Park Han Jun? From the CIU?
- You know the one.

347
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,822
He won landmark unfair labor,
harassment, and injury cases...

348
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,922
for the first time in Korea.

349
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:41,932
He'd eat Prosecutor Kim for lunch.

350
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,532
Wait, why would Park Han Jun
even take this case?

351
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:47,532
What, is he that desperate for money?

352
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,432
That's not the point.

353
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:53,472
Director Oh, this is a serial murder case.

354
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:55,912
If we can't get the death penalty,
whoever prosecutes will be crucified.

355
00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:57,512
No one is going to want to touch it.

356
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:01,912
Don't just play hot potato with the case
until it blows up in our faces.

357
00:28:02,552 --> 00:28:03,552
Let me take the case.

358
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,222
Listen, you can't take on a case like this
out of some misguided sense of justice.

359
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,692
Are my peer reviews going to be
any different next year?

360
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,892
Not unless I solve a major case myself...
There's no other way, is there?

361
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:15,932
But what if our department...

362
00:28:16,632 --> 00:28:19,062
had the prosecutor who finally took down
Park Han Jun?

363
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:21,802
Then you, the director who mentored me.

364
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:25,142
Wouldn't you be setting off fireworks
instead of a bomb?

365
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:27,742
Please, assign me the case.

366
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:39,922
(1 Ha 3, 1941)

367
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:54,432
This is Attorney Park Han Jun.

368
00:28:55,002 --> 00:28:57,032
And this is Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom.

369
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:59,042
A pleasure.

370
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,882
To give you a brief summary of the case...

371
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:06,082
You killed Moon Se Guk?

372
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:10,822
Aren't you supposed to be
the composed one here?

373
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,822
You're very impatient.

374
00:29:13,082 --> 00:29:15,992
Comes with the territory.
You hesitate, you get stabbed in the back.

375
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:19,822
Lee Woo Gyeom.

376
00:29:20,522 --> 00:29:21,662
Did you really...

377
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,132
kill Moon Se Guk?

378
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:30,232
Yes, I did. Why?

379
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:36,272
Then...

380
00:29:36,912 --> 00:29:37,912
The cure.

381
00:29:38,642 --> 00:29:40,382
The cure that Moon Se Guk had...

382
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:43,612
- What did you do with it?
- What are you talking about?

383
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,282
All I did was kill him.

384
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:47,592
What?

385
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,962
But the fact that
you're looking for a cure...

386
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,162
It must mean someone you know is very ill.

387
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:59,062
- Don't play games with me...
- Is it a family member?

388
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:01,672
Seeing how desperate you are...

389
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:03,932
Could it be the daughter
you had so late in life?

390
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:09,712
You're more naive than I thought.

391
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:11,712
No wonder you got scammed
out of 2 million dollars.

392
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:16,312
You...

393
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,882
What was your relationship
with Moon Se Guk?

394
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:24,692
Tell me exactly what you know. And...
Where is the cure that Moon Se Guk had?

395
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:26,462
I'm telling you, there's no such thing.

396
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:28,862
He said he completed the clinical trials.
He was clear.

397
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:30,832
It has to exist.

398
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:36,232
Attorney Park.

399
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,702
There is no cure for Batten disease.

400
00:30:40,812 --> 00:30:43,642
Especially for someone like Min Seo,
who's already showing early symptoms.

401
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:47,012
Death within a few years
is the only possible outcome.

402
00:30:49,852 --> 00:30:50,852
Mr. Park.

403
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:53,222
Why don't we all sit down?

404
00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:08,302
Attorney Park.

405
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:10,872
There's no need to get so worked up.

406
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:13,072
Let's have a real conversation.

407
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:15,542
Moon Se Guk may have lied to you,

408
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:17,212
but I, for one,

409
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,482
can cure Min Seo's disease.

410
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:22,052
But...

411
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:25,222
How do you...

412
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:28,052
even know my daughter's name?

413
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:34,132
Since you came all this way today,

414
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:35,892
I'll give you a retainer
of one million dollars.

415
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,002
And if you get me out of here,

416
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:41,432
- I'll give you another million dollars.
- Lee Woo Gyeom.

417
00:31:42,632 --> 00:31:44,642
Didn't I tell you to stop playing games?

418
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:48,272
You're a lawyer.
Is being scammed all you've ever known?

419
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:52,842
I have the money, if not the cure.
You don't believe me?

420
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:54,782
Reporter Jo.

421
00:31:57,412 --> 00:31:58,752
He's for real, Attorney Park.

422
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:04,462
No need to be so grateful.

423
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:07,792
It's the money
you got scammed out of anyway.

424
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,332
Let's just say I believe you.

425
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:17,332
But what if I just take the money...

426
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:19,972
and refuse to represent you?

427
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,182
I doubt that's going to happen.

428
00:32:27,552 --> 00:32:29,982
Once you meet the people I've cured,

429
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:33,852
you'll be the one coming to me.

430
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:36,992
Lee Woo Gyeom.

431
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:42,332
What makes you so confident?

432
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:45,962
They all had incurable diseases,

433
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:47,972
and I'm the one who cured them.

434
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,752
(Taesan Bank deposit: 1 million dollars,
From Lee Woo Gyeom)

435
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:16,192
A million dollars in one go. I'm jealous.

436
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:20,102
I should've studied harder in school.

437
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:23,272
Reporter Jo.

438
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:26,742
What's the deal between
you and Lee Woo Gyeom?

439
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:29,142
I already told you.

440
00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:31,882
I make the introduction,
and I get a commission.

441
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:35,012
I think it was about a week
before he was arrested.

442
00:33:35,352 --> 00:33:37,212
Lee Woo Gyeom contacted me directly.

443
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:38,782
A week before he was arrested?

444
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:41,652
I thought he was crazy at first,
of course.

445
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:46,222
But he claimed he was curing people
of incurable diseases...

446
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:47,932
and told me to go find his patients.

447
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:51,602
And there was survivor,
right there in front of me.

448
00:33:51,832 --> 00:33:54,202
And then, the money hit my account.

449
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:57,902
I figured, "This is meant to be,"
and I just went with it.

450
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:02,972
- You saw this for yourself, Reporter Jo?
- Yes. I'm the one who found them.

451
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:04,982
That's why I ended up writing the article.

452
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,312
Is that right?

453
00:34:10,012 --> 00:34:12,322
All right.
First, let's go meet this survivor.

454
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,692
(Guam Police Station)

455
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:20,062
It looks like most of the evidence
from the scene will be admissible.

456
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:22,592
The forensics lab called this morning.

457
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:27,162
They found a common substance
in all the victims' bodies.

458
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:32,242
Apparently, it's very similar
to a compound...

459
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:33,672
from a new drug just developed in the US.

460
00:34:34,102 --> 00:34:38,482
It's just strange that Lee Woo Gyeom
seems to have used it first.

461
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:43,152
The guy must've been brilliant.
He was top of his class in med school.

462
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,422
But then, the car accident happened,
and it was all over just like that.

463
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:49,652
He was in a vegetative state for 3 years,
you said?

464
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:52,192
That's right.
He only had two family members,

465
00:34:52,662 --> 00:34:54,492
and his mother passed away
while he was in that state.

466
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:57,932
So he was left with no next of kin.

467
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:02,832
And this...
This is the victims' profiles.

468
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:05,042
I think you should take a look at these.

469
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:08,412
(Summary of victims' criminal records)

470
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:11,442
They all have criminal records?

471
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:12,812
Yes.

(Guam Medical Center)

473
00:35:16,952 --> 00:35:21,022
In that case...
What kind of treatment was it?

474
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,052
Did he explain that to you?

475
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:27,692
He did, but what would I know
about any of that?

476
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:31,362
Then what made you decide
to go through with it?

477
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:37,532
My husband was in so much pain.
I just told him to do whatever he wanted.

478
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,842
Excuse me, do you know anyone else
who got the treatment before your husband?

479
00:35:41,912 --> 00:35:46,612
Yes. I was referred by Sang Woo's Mom.
We used to work together.

480
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:51,422
She said her son was cured
of incurable polio.

481
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:52,982
In that case,

482
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:56,122
could I get her contact information?

483
00:35:56,422 --> 00:36:01,432
There's the owner of the hair salon
right next door to where I used to work.

484
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,802
She and Sang Woo's mom have been friends
for a long time.

485
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:08,732
You can probably find out from her
if you go there.

Have you met any other survivors
besides him?

488
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:17,112
Besides Lee Chang Se who I just met,
it's all just been hearsay.

489
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:18,912
What? So you wrote this article...

490

An article's merit is measured in clicks,
isn't it?

493
00:36:27,682 --> 00:36:28,692
There was a time...

494
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:32,262
when you were all about social justice
and fighting the Prosecution.

495

Now it looks like all you're fighting
is your own conscience.

496
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:39,602
Gosh, that's a great line.
You should comment that on the article.

497
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:41,032
I bet it would go viral.

498

- Goodness.
- Sure. I'll comment that it's all lies.

499
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:49,112
Come on. The other one sounded better.
You should post that one, word for word.

500
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,212
Cut the crap and tell me already.

501

Besides the victims
whose dismembered bodies turned up,

the other ten...

503

- Where did you dump their bodies?
- If you look at it from another angle,

504
00:37:01,892 --> 00:37:03,422
that's not what's important
here at all.

505
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:08,332
You killed 17 people.

506
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:11,632
You should see it as me saving them,
not killing them.

507
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,172
Is that really what's important to you?

508
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:21,512
Not the fact that all your victims
had criminal records?

509
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:26,842
You figured that out sooner
than I expected.

510
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:31,082
So at trial, you were planning on saying,
"I only killed bad guys."

511
00:37:31,222 --> 00:37:33,122
"Please let me off the hook?" Is that it?

512
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:36,452
Please. That's so childish.
I have some self-respect.

513
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:39,962
Stop posturing. This is vigilantism.

514
00:37:40,362 --> 00:37:41,862
You really think that's going to hold up
in court?

515
00:37:46,232 --> 00:37:50,232
Prosecutor Cha.
I saved patients with incurable diseases.

516
00:37:51,032 --> 00:37:53,842
Their deaths were a necessary sacrifice
to save others.

517
00:37:53,842 --> 00:37:55,242
So when exactly were you going to ask me
about that?

518
00:37:55,912 --> 00:37:58,242
Even if you saved 100 or 1,000 people,

519
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:00,942
killing someone means you're a murderer,
doesn't it?

520
00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:08,322
Isn't that simpler math than 17 minus 17?

521
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,392
Are we done here?

522
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:12,722
Sit down.

523
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:16,192
You don't get up before I do.

524
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:19,762
If you wanted to be treated like a human,
you should've acted like one.

525
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:23,632
Don't get cocky,
you murdering son of a gun.

526
00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:24,972
I apologize.

527
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:28,412
Such a self-righteous ass.

528
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:31,982
- What was that?
- Nothing.

529
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:35,252
Forget it.

530
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,452
You don't have to tell me
where you dumped them.

531
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:41,852
I've already identified all the victims,
and I have more than enough to indict you.

532
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:44,922
I couldn't care less
about your so-called "cure."

533
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:48,562
You can go ahead
and run your mouth in court.

534
00:38:53,962 --> 00:38:56,032
You're just taking your bad mood out on me
because it's hot.

535
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,312
If you insist on being this stubborn,

536
00:39:03,412 --> 00:39:04,842
you're the one walking away with nothing.

537
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,562
We have to find those dump sites,
no matter what.

538
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,832
What? You're saying
Lee Woo Gyeom won't cooperate?

539

He's just trying to play games with us.

540

If we just let him
spoon-feed us the answers,

541
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:35,272
it'll be humiliating.

542

But Prosecutor Cha,

543
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:39,012
if you could persuade him,
we could find the victims much sooner...

544
00:39:39,082 --> 00:39:40,982
Persuade him?
I ought to be chewing him out.

545
00:39:41,452 --> 00:39:44,082
We'll find them on our own,
and then we'll indict him.

546
00:39:44,452 --> 00:39:46,722
- Got it?
- Yes, ma'am. Understood.

547
00:39:47,082 --> 00:39:49,222
I'll expand the search parameters
and get started.

548
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:53,262
I think we've checked everything here.

We're from the Guam Police Station.

- Are any cameras installed?

At our shop...

555
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:06,902
By any chance,
could we check your CCTV footage?

556

or her new phone number...
Do you happen to have it?

566
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:39,072
She only told me she'd contact me
once she got settled.

She didn't give me any other details.

when she was here.

It was nowhere near enough.

or Sang Woo used to frequent?

Or someone who was like family to them,
like you?

00:44:17,152 --> 00:44:19,122
Start with how you made it.

627
00:44:23,032 --> 00:44:24,132
Are you going to tell me or not?

628
00:44:30,302 --> 00:44:34,242
The cure...
It all began with a dying potted plant.

629
00:44:36,612 --> 00:44:39,542
I poured some leftover liquid
from my research into the pot,

630
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:45,352
and when I checked on it the next day,

631
00:44:46,552 --> 00:44:48,422
the dead flower had come back to life.

632
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:51,592
That's the cure?

633
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:53,092
Yes.

634
00:44:54,062 --> 00:44:55,092
Go on.

635
00:44:56,562 --> 00:44:58,562
Next, I took that cure,

636
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:00,932
and put it in a fish tank.

637
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,332
My dead goldfish came back to life.

638
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:09,842
Then there was a cat with an injured leg.
It recovered so well that...

639
00:45:11,172 --> 00:45:12,312
it was jumping high again in no time.

640
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:20,852
At this point, aren't you curious too?

641
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,892
If it works on humans.

642
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,092
That's when you started killing people?

643
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:32,762
I told you, it wasn't murder.
It was research.

644
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:38,872
- How long did you plan to keep this up?
- But the thing is...

645
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:41,812
Humans are definitely a lot harder.

646
00:45:42,512 --> 00:45:44,112
How long...

647
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,282
did you plan on going around
killing people?

648
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:52,922
Seventeen people.

649
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:54,752
That was it.

650
00:45:56,392 --> 00:45:57,392
Why?

651
00:45:58,252 --> 00:45:59,662
Because the experiment was a success.

652
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:04,032
Who was the last victim?

653
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:06,902
Hong Jae Gwang.

654
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:08,832
Are you sure about that?

655
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:10,902
Yes.

656
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,872
You'll understand
when you see him for yourself.

657
00:46:16,912 --> 00:46:19,712
It's a little complicated
to explain in words.

658
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:25,352
(Guam District Prosecutors' Office)

659
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:36,392
Okay.

660
00:46:37,492 --> 00:46:39,602
Why didn't you resist arrest?

661
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:42,072
You could've gotten away.

662
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:44,932
I was planning to turn myself in
after treating my patient,

663
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:46,972
Lee Chang Se, anyway.

664
00:46:49,312 --> 00:46:50,312
Turn yourself in?

665
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:54,712
I was just waiting for the right moment
to prove my abilities.

666
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,352
You didn't catch me.

667
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,692
Why do you insist on proving it,

668
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:04,222
specifically through a trial?

669
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:07,792
Because that's the most official,
indisputable way.

670
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:16,032
That's how I can be forgiven for my sins.

671
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:21,642
Not forgiveness. Condemnation.

672
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:24,772
We'll see about that.

673
00:47:26,382 --> 00:47:27,382
Okay.

674
00:47:29,982 --> 00:47:30,982
All right.

675
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:34,482
I've heard enough about the history
of your so-called cure.

676
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:36,322
Now,

677
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:39,992
it's your turn to help me out.

678
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:43,292
Where did you dump the remaining victims?

679
00:47:49,102 --> 00:47:50,902
On the mid-slope of Mount Cheonggye,

680
00:47:51,672 --> 00:47:54,672
facing the river,
at the 100-meter mark.

681
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,112
Be more thorough!

682
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,222
- Bring it here.
- Yes, sir.

683
00:48:07,222 --> 00:48:09,022
- Let's go.
- All right.

684
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:21,972
I heard there's something called
a plea bargain in trials.

685
00:48:22,772 --> 00:48:27,042
- Yes.
- Well, I don't want a lighter sentence.

686
00:48:29,442 --> 00:48:31,012
I want to make a different kind of deal.

687
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,512
First, I'll need you...

688
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:38,782
to help me so that
I can prove my abilities in court.

689
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:49,992
(Liked by 99_guswn and others)

690
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:53,202
Okay, thank you.

691
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:57,602
Attorney Park.

692
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,302
No matter how much I dig,
I'm coming up empty.

693
00:49:02,012 --> 00:49:04,412
I'm thinking,
since Sang Woo's leg was injured,

694
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:06,742
maybe he just drew those pictures
at home by himself?

695
00:49:08,442 --> 00:49:09,712
We have to find him.

696
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:11,752
Right.

697
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:23,262
- Hello?
- Mr. Park? Hi, it's the hair salon.

698
00:49:23,332 --> 00:49:24,332
Right.

699
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,242
So this is the place.

700
00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:48,892
Is anyone here?

701
00:49:54,362 --> 00:49:56,962
You're going to demonstrate your abilities
in court?

702
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,402
Because I've been indulging you,

703
00:50:01,362 --> 00:50:02,472
you're getting pretty cocky, aren't you?

704
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:08,502
Aren't you the one who's excited,
Prosecutor Cha?

705
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:13,382
Thrilled this case will make your career,
aren't you?

706
00:50:16,552 --> 00:50:20,622
Or is it thanks to your powerful father
that you think you're above it all?

707
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:26,422
This punk.
You've really crossed the line today.

708
00:50:57,192 --> 00:50:59,262
- Mom.
- Yes, sweetie?

709
00:51:12,942 --> 00:51:14,572
Hey! Bring me a shovel!

710
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:26,282
I found it!

711
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:31,492
Over here! I found it!

712
00:51:31,752 --> 00:51:33,722
- Get a shovel over here!
- We found it!

713
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:35,022
- Right here!
- We found it!

714
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,702
- Hey, get the gear over here now!
- Over here! We found it!

715
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,102
- We found it!
- We found it!

716
00:51:41,262 --> 00:51:43,502
- On my way!
- We found it!

717
00:51:43,502 --> 00:51:44,902
- I said it's over here.
- Yes, coming!

718
00:51:44,972 --> 00:51:46,472
- Here! Over here!
- Hey, hurry up!

719
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:48,502
I found it! It's here, right here!

720
00:51:53,842 --> 00:51:55,112
I think it's Hong Jae Gwang.

721
00:51:55,882 --> 00:51:57,712
The body's been completely drained
of blood.

722
00:52:03,752 --> 00:52:05,722
You'll see for yourself once you check.

723
00:52:06,392 --> 00:52:09,132
It's complicated to explain in words,
you see.

724
00:52:14,362 --> 00:52:16,172
Moon Se Guk lied,

725
00:52:18,332 --> 00:52:19,402
but as for me,

726
00:52:20,872 --> 00:52:22,542
I can cure Min Seo's illness.

727
00:52:23,342 --> 00:52:24,742
Every single one of them...

728
00:52:26,182 --> 00:52:27,712
was treated by me.

729
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:43,862
Now it's your turn to cross the line,
Prosecutor Cha.

730
00:52:45,702 --> 00:52:47,032
Come over to my side.

731
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:49,802
I will personally show you in court.

732
00:52:51,472 --> 00:52:52,572
How I can save a life...

733
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:56,172
without so much as a scalpel.
