there's one thing I believe.

00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:17,040
My mom would do anything to protect my dad.

170
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,864
I think...

171
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,420
she's definitely hiding something from me.

172
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,864
Otherwise, Baikhaw's family
wouldn't have ended up like this.

173
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,350
Sometimes I'm scared that

174
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,048
what Baikhaw said might actually be true.

175
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,008
If we can't get answers
from Tulip's parents...

176
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,736
then why don't we find out ourselves?

177
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,712
Thank you for coming.

178
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,736
I have to check on the house
regularly anyway,

179
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,840
in case Baikhaw comes back to see her mother.

180
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,936
But why do you want to go inside?

181
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:18,656
I forgot my schoolbooks here.

182
00:13:18,656 --> 00:13:20,700
I just need to grab them.

183
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,176
Could you open the door for us, please?

184
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,672
Sure.

185
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,496
Go ahead.

186
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,952
The court ruling in the case
where Baikhaw's father sued Tulip's father...

187
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,683
if we want to request a copy from the court,

188
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,200
we'd need a power of attorney

189
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,980
or consent from Tulip's father first.

190
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:50,900
Since we can't get it that way,

191
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,530
this is the only place left to look.

192
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,760
I believe Baikhaw must have kept it.

193
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,770
And in there, we may find the real reason

194
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,904
why Baikhaw hates Tulip's parents.

Tulip! Tulip!

337
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,820
Drop the weapon!

338
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,624
Come here!

339
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,630
Hello, ma'am. I'm Namo.

340
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,128
Tulip's inside, right?

341
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,610
Yes.

342
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,456
And Tao?

343
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,760
Why did you leave me and Mom, Dad?

344
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,460
Khawfang.

345
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,720
Come sit with Mommy, sweetheart.

346
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,264
Baikhaw.

347
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,080
Baikhaw!

348
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,448
Come sit with me.

349
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,520
Bring Khawfang with you.

350
00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:12,712
Khawfang.

351
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,620
Remember this, my baby.

352
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,490
They killed your little sister.

353
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,216
Because of them, this is what we've become.

354
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,910
Mom.

355
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,800
Where's Namo?

356
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,688
Namo went to the police station to see Tao.

357
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:51,840
He should be back soon.

358
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:58,256
And... how is Baikhaw's mom?

359
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,200
She...

360
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,232
lost too much blood.

361
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,792
She's gone now.

362
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:12,910
But... but, Mom...

363
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,890
Tao didn't do it.

364
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,060
Baikhaw's mom lunged at him herself.

365
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,704
Tao and Namo
already told the police everything.

366
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,400
I know everything now.

367
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:45,024
Know what?

368
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,736
Dad's case.

369
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,893
What Dad did...

370
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:57,800
it really happened. I remember now.

371
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,720
- Sir... sir!
- You fabricated this.

372
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,520
You filed a complaint with the university,
accusing me of losing control.

373
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,190
Even though I've never treated a student
that way.

374
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,710
Are you trying to threaten me
into dropping the case against your husband?

375
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,340
What happened to your wife
is not my husband's fault.

376
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,700
If it's not, then that's bullshit.

377
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,910
So you're going to squeeze me
from every angle, huh?

378
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,300
Fine.

379
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,340
If you want me fired, then I'll leave.

380
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,420
And I'll fight you in court.

381
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,300
Gladly.

382
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,940
Orderly! Orderly! Help, please!

383
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,768
Yes.

384
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:33,280
- This way, please.
- Please step outside.

385
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,424
- Outside, please.
- Remember this! Remember it!

386
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:36,904
Please.

387
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,150
The records from the day his wife came in

388
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,950
have all been deleted, right?

389
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,832
All done.

390
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,296
Baikhaw was probably abused
by her own mother since she was a child...

391
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,430
because of Dad and you.

392
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,580
You're the reason Baikhaw ended up like this.

393
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,232
Tulip!

394
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,328
What are you talking about?

395
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,744
You're just mixing things up now.

396
00:30:14,744 --> 00:30:16,860
Then tell me this.

397
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,560
Say that Dad didn't do it.

398
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,280
Things have already gone this far.

399
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,650
Tulip!

400
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,789
That's not it.

401
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,910
If that's not true...

402
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,660
then why, that day,

403
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,408
did you order Baikhaw's mom's medical records
to be deleted?

404
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,178
If Dad didn't do anything,
why would you do that?

405
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,728
Why pretend Dad did nothing to Baikhaw's mom?

406
00:30:49,136 --> 00:30:53,230
Tulip, I'm sorry.

407
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,416
- I'm sorry.
- Let go.

408
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,350
Please leave.

409
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,304
- Tulip...
- I want to be alone.

410
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,604
Tulip, honey.

411
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,627
Do you want to go out
and get something to eat?

412
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,170
I'm tired.

413
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,944
I want to rest.

414
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,790
She's acting up.

415
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,744
Aren't you going to do anything?

416
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,040
Tulip.

417
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,448
Don't walk away from me like this.

418
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,760
From now on, come straight home after class.

419
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,620
Stop all university activities.

420
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,144
I'll screen every one of your friends,

421
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:03,940
so you won't hang out with psychos again.

422
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,872
What's so funny, huh?

423
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,700
After everything that's happened,

424
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,552
you still don't feel any remorse at all,
do you?

425
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,490
You don't even have the courage

426
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,670
to take responsibility for what you did.

427
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,048
And what do you think you're doing,
trying to protect me?

428
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,110
Do you and Mom even realize
what you did to another family?

429
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,416
Now it's all come back to hurt me.

430
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:36,976
Do you see what I've had to go through?

431
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:40,000
If you had just listened to your parents,

432
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,632
- none of this would've happened.
- Fine!

433
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:46,120
It's all my fault... every damn thing.

434
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,810
And the biggest mistake of all

435
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,000
was being born to parents like you.

436
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,120
You deal with our daughter.

I'm busy enough with my job transfer.

No!

00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,728
I'm not doing anything.

00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,880
From now on...

442
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:28,752
I'll only do my duty to protect my family

443

regardless of whether "family"
includes you or not.

I don't think I can stay here anymore, Namo.

445
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,533
I'll come pick you up.

446
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,136
Okay.

447
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,968
I found this over there.

448
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,352
Did you forget to pack it?

449
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,376
Just leave it here.

I know the whole truth now.

- I'm sorry on behalf of my parents...
- Isn't that a little too easy?

What else do you want me to do?

455
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,856
I'm sorry.

456
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:39,480
You can get better.

457
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,520
- I can help you.
- Why would you help me?

458

I have no one left now.
