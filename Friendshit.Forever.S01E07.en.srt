1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,856
How could she have no shame at all?

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,752
Crisp and clear, 4k quality.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,790
I watched your clip today.
I was so turned on.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,715
Wanna try?

5
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:13,910
I'd never sleep with trash like you,
you piece of shit.

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,800
I wouldn't want a bitch like you either.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,680
This is what you want, right?

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,224
Tulip will come back to me
at the cost of your life.

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,768
[Tao]

10
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,420
Hey, there was another stabbing at the bar.

11
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,660
Another stabbing?

12
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,820
That makes two bodies tonight, Lieutenant.

13
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,144
The owner says he checked the footage.

14
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:43,248
The perpetrator is a woman.

15
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,160
Then let's go check the CCTV.

16
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,936
Let's go.

17
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,440
Same tea as before, so you can sleep.

18
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:20,420
I'm the owner of the car with the dashcam.

19
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,928
I've sent you the clip.

20
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,390
Hey, Tulip. Hello?

21
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,240
Namo got hit by a car... Was that you, Tao?

22
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,900
How did you find out?

23
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,208
What the hell is wrong with you?

24
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,928
Tulip, calm down first.

25
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:07,544
I know I messed up. You can be mad at me.

26
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:10,970
But right now, I need you to trust me.

27
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,170
What else do you expect me to believe?

28
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,425
Tulip, I think...

29
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,728
Baikhaw hurt Wawwa.

30
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,120
I don't know why either.

31
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,040
But right now, you're in danger.

32
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,224
Please get out of there now.

33
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,936
Then tell me why Baikhaw would do that.

34
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,664
I don't know either,

35
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:41,936
but Baikhaw told me to date you
and then dump you.

36
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,650
And about Namo getting hit...

37
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:51,160
Baikhaw tried to stop him
from telling you about me and Baikhaw.

38
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,664
At first, I thought she just held some grudge
against you.

39
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:02,460
But now I don't think that's it.

40
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,779
I think...

41
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,184
Baikhaw is possessive of you.

42
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:19,640
Tulip? Hello? Tulip?

43
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,420
Hey, can you reach your friend Baikhaw?

44
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,608
I can't either. Is something wrong?

45
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:28,620
There was a fatal stabbing at the bar.

46
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,120
Can you come check the footage with us?

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,008
- Sure.
- Let's go.

48
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,600
Awake?

49
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,128
What are you doing?

50
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,580
I was gonna ask you to come to my place.

51
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,696
I don't want you staying here alone.

52
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,720
And my mom's not doing well right now.

53
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,648
Can you come with me?

54
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,080
Yeah, sure.

55
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,770
Let me pack first.

56
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,216
Okay.

57
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,010
Do you know this person?

58
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,168
- Shit! That's Q.
- You know him?

59
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:15,340
Not really. He's a senior from my university.

60
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,544
This is CCTV footage from the bar.

61
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,340
Baikhaw?

62
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,184
She really is your friend, right?

63
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:30,040
Hang on a second.

64
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,136
I told you, my girlfriend isn't picking up.
Please just let me in.

65
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:36,488
Hey, I said you can't.

66
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:39,088
Without a keycard,
a resident has to come down to get you.

67
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:41,472
I told you, I called her,
and she didn't answer.

68
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:42,736
Why don't you calm down?

69
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,440
Let her cool off, then talk things out.

70
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,120
I'm not fighting with her.

71
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,552
I need to go up there now!

72
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,952
- Hey! You're not listening!
- Let go.

73
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:51,000
Is something wrong?

74
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,104
Sir, please.

75
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,280
My girlfriend is in room 805.

76
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,720
If I don't get up there right now,
she might die.

77
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,360
Please let me go up.

78
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,320
Oh, that room?

79
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,424
You mean Tulip, right?

80
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:03,130
Yes. Do you know her?

81
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,936
I just saw her leave a moment ago.

82
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:06,408
She left with Baikhaw, her roommate.

83
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you know where they went?

84
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,640
No, I don't.

85
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,280
Come on in.

86
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,776
Okay.

87
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,460
You can head home now.
I'll take it from here.

88
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,088
- Alright.
- Thank you.

89
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:54,456
Sure.

90
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,688
Do you really need to shut everything
this tight?

91
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:11,168
Yeah.

92
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,328
Shouldn't you go check on your mom?

93
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:20,008
Yeah. I'll be right back.

94
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,208
What are you doing?

95
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,550
Who are you talking to?

96
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,550
I'm looking for a charger. My phone died.

97
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,392
Who were you talking to?

98
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:48,310
I wasn't talking to anyone.

99
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,344
- I asked who you were talking to.
- What is wrong with you?

100
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:51,912
- I wasn't talking to anyone.
- Give me your phone.

101
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:54,880
- Just tell me who you were talking to.
- No one...

102
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,232
Mom!

103
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:03,330
Mom! Mom!

104
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,040
Mom, I'm here.

105
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,560
They took my child.

106
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,856
Mom, I'm right here.

107
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,250
- Mom, mom...
- They took my baby. No, no!

108
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,080
- It's me. It's me. I'm right here.
- No...

109
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,712
Bring me Khawfang.

110
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:16,360
Mom, I brought my sister here.

111
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,088
- Where? Where?
- She's right here, Mom.

112
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:21,240
There. There.

113
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,440
Come here.

114
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,784
Get over here.

115
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,928
- Khawfang.
- Mom, Mom...

116
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,256
Mom.

117
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,696
We're all together now, Mom.

118
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,472
- You're not my child.
- Mom!

119
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:52,792
- You're not my child!
- Mom!

120
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,496
Give me my child!

121
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,424
Bring me my child!

122
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,780
- Give me my child!
- Mom!

123
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,490
- Why did you take my child away?
- Stop it, Mom.

124
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,680
Bring her back!

125
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,010
Why the hell do you have news clippings
about my parents?

126
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,888
What are you planning to do?

127
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,792
It's late. Go lie down.

128
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,160
- Lie down? Hell no. I'm leaving.
- Come on.

129
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,448
Didn't you say you'd stay with me?
Where are you going?

130
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,920
Going to those assholes?

131
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,970
They're all taking advantage of you.

132
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,460
Not me.

133
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,952
Stay here.
You'd better let me take care of you.

134
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,160
What the hell is wrong with you?

135
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,192
- I'm not staying. What is wrong with you?
- Hey!

136
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,630
Your parents are shit.

137
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,704
Your dad is a cheater.

138
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:16,928
Your mom is useless.
She can't take care of you. Why go back?

139
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:19,248
- Shut up.
- I won't!

140
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,710
Your parents...

141
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,432
They did a lot of shit you don't know about.
Let me tell you.

142
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,184
They put on a fake image
and destroyed my family.

143
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,032
Your parents...

144
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,300
They ruined my family.

145
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,170
Dad!

146
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,060
Dad!

147
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,080
Dad!

148
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,272
I've got nothing left. Can't you see that?

149
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,460
Can't you see what my mom has become?

150
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,888
Do you see how she is now?

151
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:59,150
That's all because of your parents.

152
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,152
And now I'm going to make you
my little sister.

153
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:05,032
I'm not going with you, Baikhaw!

154
00:13:05,032 --> 00:13:06,430
I'm not going.

155
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,700
Ow!

156
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,500
Crazy bitch, let me go!

157
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,488
Baikhaw!

158
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,512
Let go!

159
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,968
You have two fractured ribs.

160
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:12,570
I'll prescribe pain medication for now.

161
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,360
Thank you.

162
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,216
Now that you're awake,
I'll let your friend Tulip know.

163
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:25,320
She asked us to call her
the moment you woke up.

164
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,480
Tulip?

165
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,096
Yes.

166
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,984
Are you hungry?

167
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,480
Just let me go.

168
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,700
You're stubborn.

169
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,696
You don't listen to me.

170
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,320
Why are you doing this?

171
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,872
Eat.

172
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,176
Your parents are awful.

173
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,220
They can't take care of you.

174
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,408
So it has to be me.

175
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,504
Honestly, I...

176
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,928
I treated you well in every way.

177
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,880
I've protected you from everything.

178
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,130
But you never appreciate anything I do.

179
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,880
Why?

180
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:11,460
You're just as shitty as your parents.

181
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:32,888
What are you doing?

182
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,152
Baikhaw!

183
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,296
Don't.

184
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,400
I really wanna know.

185
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,184
If your parents...

186
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:02,490
If they found out
that bad things happened to you...

187
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,770
what kind of face would they make?

188
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,280
I wanna see their faces so damn bad.

189
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,864
They'd probably...

190
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:15,670
fall apart completely.

191
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,024
Right?

192
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,456
Eat.

193
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,150
You bitch, eat.

194
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,040
Baikhaw, sister, please!

195
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,424
Let me go. You're hurting me.

196
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,328
Bitch! My sister is dead, asshole!

197
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:03,168
Damn it! Eat it.

198
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,696
Eat.

199
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,568
Bitch.

200
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,056
Don't, Baikhaw!

201
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:22,170
- Please...
- I told you to eat nicely.

202
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,700
Please.

203
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,730
I'm begging you.

204
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,440
Please don't hurt me. I'm begging you.

205
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,216
Turn over, bitch.

206
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,144
Help!

207
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:38,184
Help! Somebody help!

208
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,232
Help me!

209
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,792
Shut up!

210
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,872
What the hell are you doing here, Tao?

211
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:58,890
- Tulip!
- What are you doing?

212
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,840
- Where's Tulip?
- I don't know.

213
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,704
Baikhaw!

214
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,112
Tulip!

215
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:17,952
Tulip!

216
00:19:17,952 --> 00:19:18,880
- Tao!
- Tulip!

217
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,984
Are you okay? Are you safe?

218
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,824
- Tao, watch out!
- Ow! What's this?

219
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,072
Are you okay?

220
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,923
Tulip, look out!

221
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,160
Baikhaw!

222
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,944
Tulip!

223
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,848
Tao!

224
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,912
Tulip, run!

225
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,440
Tulip!

226
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:14,780
Baikhaw! Let go!

227
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,740
Tulip!

228
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,800
Tulip!

229
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,224
Tulip!

230
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,392
Tulip! Let's go. Hurry!

231
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:42,808
Hurry!

232
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,576
Hello?

233
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,160
Hello, Tulip.

234
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,590
It's me.

235
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,432
Namo...

236
00:21:18,664 --> 00:21:20,504
Namo.

237
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,160
It's okay now.

238
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:36,632
I'm sorry I didn't believe you
from the start.

239
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:41,840
As long as you're safe, that's enough for me.

240
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,264
I don't need anything more than that.

241
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,000
Excuse me.

242
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,980
Miss Tulip,

243
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,912
you said Baikhaw fell down
the overpass stairs, correct?

244
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:08,740
Yes.

245
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,632
Well...

246
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,368
Dispatch 20 reporting.

247
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,416
24 received a report of someone
falling down the overpass stairs.

248
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,560
When we checked the scene,
we found no injured person.

249
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:30,560
You just bought this place.
Planning to sell it already?

250
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,496
My daughter wants to move back home with us.

251
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:56,060
Come home and stay with us for now.

252
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,336
I'll find you a new place later.

253
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,360
Mom, do you think the police
will find Baikhaw?

254
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,888
The police are good at their job.
They'll find her.

255
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:20,712
I still don't understand
why Baikhaw would do all of this.

256
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,680
I guess she might be the only one who knows.

257
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,930
Mom. Let me ask you something.

258
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,650
Have you ever met Baikhaw before?

259
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,160
Before she became my friend?

260
00:23:40,496 --> 00:23:43,300
Never. Why?

261
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:50,210
Your parents did a lot of shit
you don't know about. Let me tell you.

262
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,050
I don't know, Mom.

263
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,984
She always said weird things.

264
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,320
What did she say?

265
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,320
She talked like she knew our family.

266
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,680
And she was extremely possessive of me.

267
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,360
She said she loved me
like I was her real little sister.

268
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,100
It sounds like
she may have a delusional disorder.

269
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,048
She's holding false beliefs.

270
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:29,030
You mean like,
she believed I was her real sister who died?

271
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,380
Baikhaw may have created
an imaginary world of her own.

272
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,700
And she believed
she was truly your older sister.

273
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,360
Can this condition get so bad
that someone could kill because of it?

274
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,090
It becomes severe
when their feelings are rejected

275
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,790
or when they feel ignored
or not responded to.

276
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,488
Because people with this condition

277
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:56,560
believe they have the right
to control another person's life.

278
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:03,250
And most of the time, it worsens
when they lose their sense of control,

279
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,432
combined with sociopathic traits,
a lack of empathy.

280
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:12,380
They do not feel guilty after hurting others,

281
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,180
to the point it becomes
antisocial personality disorder.

282
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:23,392
It's a mental condition that involves
an antisocial pattern.

283
00:25:24,984 --> 00:25:27,490
Excuse me.

284
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,272
I found this over there.

285
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:31,352
Did you forget to pack it?

286
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,530
Just leave it here.

287
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,384
It's not mine.

288
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,740
We couldn't find her anywhere, sir.

289
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,088
Ma'am, can you please tell us
where your daughter is?

290
00:26:31,612 --> 00:26:35,200
[Ms. Wawwa Chirapachara;
Born March 14, 2006; Died October 25, 2025]

291
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:25,340
Has Baikhaw contacted you at all?

292
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:31,150
I honestly don't know where she is either.

293
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,504
I know that in all this...

294
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,856
you might see yourself as a victim.

295
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,064
But to me,

296
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:50,540
I can't forget what you did.

297
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,144
I understand.

298
00:27:57,016 --> 00:28:02,104
And I'll keep apologizing to you
until you forgive me.

299
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,096
That day will never come.

300
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,860
I want you to feel guilty

301
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,520
right up to the day you die.

302
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:37,840
Dear!

303
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,480
I sent you to study, not to cause trouble.

304
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,720
I don't even know
how to show my face anymore.

305
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,144
Losing your scholarship wasn't enough.

306
00:28:45,144 --> 00:28:47,688
You almost killed someone with your car.

307
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,950
Please, enough.

308
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,460
He's hurt.

309
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,456
Why didn't you just die?

310
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:56,030
It would've saved me this humiliation.

311
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,480
All of this is your own doing.

312
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,680
You ruined yourself over a girl.

313
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,872
- Dear!
- Let me go!

314
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,940
Honey.

315
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,696
Our daughter is home.

316
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,272
Tulip.

317
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,272
Tulip, I'm sorry.

318
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,640
I misunderstood you.

319
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,456
And because of that, I almost lost you.

320
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,140
Tulip.

321
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,736
Have some shrimp, dear.

322
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,024
Thank you.

323
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,060
After everything you've just been through,

324
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,336
do you want to take a break from school?

325
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,580
It's okay.

326
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,390
I can handle it.

327
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,720
Mom said that...

328
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,648
you were called in by the board
because of me.

329
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,800
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

330
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,280
It's alright.

331
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,740
You're not at fault.

332
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,530
- That little bitch is the one to blame.
- Honey...

333
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,056
What?

I'm not as patient
or understanding as you are.

335
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,968
She did this to our daughter.

336
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:29,760
When the police find her,

337
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,832
I'll make sure she gets what she deserves.

338
00:31:38,174 --> 00:31:41,200
When I went to Baikhaw's house,

339
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,860
she didn't just have information about me.

340
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:50,704
She had records and news articles
about you both.

341
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,680
I mean, you don't know Baikhaw, right?

342
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,112
But what about Baikhaw's mother?

343
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:08,560
Do you recognize the name...

344
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,584
Fahrung Chanchaliaosap?

345
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,340
She's Baikhaw's mother?

346
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,960
Yes.

347
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,576
- Do you know her?
- No!

348
00:32:31,152 --> 00:32:32,592
But...

349
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,620
Her mother lost a baby during pregnancy.

350
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,728
Could she have been one of your patients?

351
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:42,720
I said I don't know her.

352
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,928
She's mentally unstable.

353
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:46,720
She'll say anything.

354
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,160
From now on, stay home. Don't go anywhere.

355
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,120
Be careful.

356
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,736
I'll have someone install CCTV
around the house.

357
00:32:58,928 --> 00:33:00,312

I haven't been sleeping well, Namo.

381
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,820
Some days, I still hear a lullaby

382
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,360
that Baikhaw used to sing to me.

383
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,260
And on some nights, I dream about her.

384
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,470
In those dreams, she's terrifying.

I don't trust anyone.

390
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,424
I don't want to talk to anyone.

391

I don't want to see anyone.

392

But sometimes when I'm alone,
I'm scared anyway.

393
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,872
I try not to blame myself
for everything that happened,

394
00:36:57,872 --> 00:37:00,110
that it's my fault.

395

But in the end,
no matter how you look at the situation,

396
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:10,320
I can't help but feel like Wawwa and Q died
