1
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,992
THE JUDGE RETURNS

2
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,497
LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE

3
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:43,542
I knew it.

4
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:02,561
I didn't realize
my enemies were everywhere.

5
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:08,650
What's that nonsense?

6
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:11,445
Enemies?

7
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,323
It's not nonsense.

8
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:55,614
Huh?

9
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,409
This is why we need the law.

10
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,420
You bastards!

11
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,674
What are you doing here?
I waited forever for you to return.

12
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:57,885
Did he borrow money from you, too?

13
00:02:58,093 --> 00:02:59,636
Who did this to my boss?

14
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:02,472
Not me.

15
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:03,849
It's him.

16
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,189
You bastard!

17
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:14,610
Hey!

18
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:24,828
Damn it.

19
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,210
Hey.

20
00:03:58,195 --> 00:03:59,196
You okay?

21
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,781
I told you to wait!

22
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:01,907
Be quiet.

23
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,247
You little bastard!

24
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,134
You sure you're fine?

25
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,012
I'm fine.

26
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:26,682
EPISODE 8

27
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:28,642
Hey, I'm stuck!

28
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,574
Take Chu Yong-jin and Cheon Hak-su.

29
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:46,660
They're at the Buyong Police Station
in Incheon.

30
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:49,121
I'll also send you the ledger

31
00:04:49,204 --> 00:04:50,831
of the kickbacks between Chu and Kang.

32
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,124
Okay.

33
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,839
KICKBACK LEDGER FOR JT

34
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:00,215
All done. Let's go.

35
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:02,217
PROSECUTION SERVICE

36
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:07,014
KICKBACK LEDGER FOR JT

37
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:08,390
Right on.

38
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:40,672
Sorry.

39
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,676
Some guys came and ruined my plan.

40
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,268
Yong-jin got away.

41
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,146
Mr. Kang.

42
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:57,564
Yeah.

43
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:01,360
I know the ferry terminal.
I'll take care of it immediately.

44
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:02,444
No.

45
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:05,864
Would you take the ferry
if you were in his shoes?

46
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:08,992
Oh.

47
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:13,789
What should we do?

48
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:16,083
It won't be easy to find him
if he hides from us.

49
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,210
We have to cut him off.

50
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:19,753
Mr. Kang

51
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:22,506
I really don't have a good feeling
about Judge Lee.

52
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:24,841
Since the draft dodger list

53
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,260
plans keep getting ruined

54
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:29,262
since meeting Judge Lee.

55
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:18,019
Who was it?

56
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,774
They seemed to know

57
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,402
Yong-jin and his gang.

58
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,381
You need to make yourself useful

59
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,094
if you want to stick around.

60
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:56,725
I know you know it.

61
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:02,147
That I'm the only one
who can mend your scars.

62
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:15,410
Let me give you a job.

63
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,556
I really don't have a good feeling
about Judge Lee.

64
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,267
Since the draft dodger list

65
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,603
our plans keep getting ruined

66
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:43,480
since meeting Judge Lee.

67
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,320
We'll find out soon enough.

68
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:58,954
PROSECUTION SERVICE

69
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:01,248
I printed this file from your flash drive.

70
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,292
The guy who ordered his men to kill you

71
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:07,837
and the "JT" here are
both Mr. Kang Jeong-tae, right?

72
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:08,922
I know I'm right.

73
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,970
Gosh.

74
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,558
Would you also charge him

75
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,395
with attempted murder?

76
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:28,316
Technically, it's solicitation of murder.

77
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:41,162
Yes, the "JT" written here refers

78
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,123
to Mr. Kang Jeong-tae

79
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:45,208
the third-term politician
from the majority party.

80
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:48,920
I sent him money every month

81
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:51,172
and delivered loads of cash
during election seasons.

82
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,717
As soon as my investigation ended

83
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,844
he pressured me to smuggle myself out
on a ferry.

84
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:00,390
I guess he just wanted to feed me
to the sharks.

85
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:13,486
Gosh, that's refreshing.

86
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:17,490
But you know

87
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,118
my stomach feels a bit queasy

88
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,911
drinking cold water on an empty stomach.

89
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:23,955
What's good around here?

90
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,457
Let's grab lunch together.

91
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,918
I'll serve it to you on a silver platter.

92
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,503
As much as I'd love that

93
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:33,923
it's only a matter of time
until Mr. Kang finds out that you're here.

94
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:38,511
I have to hustle to get the arrest warrant
before that.

95
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:40,680
Why don't you eat first and wait?

96
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:44,434
Oh, and jeyuk bokkeum is good

97
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:46,144
around here.

98
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,523
He mentioned Mr. Kang Jeong-tae.

99
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,400
They're preparing
the arrest warrant for him soon.

100
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:06,247
Mr. Woo Gyo-hun.

101
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,792
You admitted to falsifying your address.
Is that right?

102
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,251
Yes.

103
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:13,838
My daughter had depression.

104
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:17,842
But she had one friend
whom she could rely on

105
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:20,595
and I committed such an act

106
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,597
so they could attend the same school.

107
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:25,392
I apologize.

108
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,232
LEE SEONG-HUN, HAN SANG-MIN

109
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:39,739
You refused to submit

110
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:43,159
your daughter's medical report
that was requested.

111
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:50,166
Because it would infringe
on patient confidentiality.

112
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,960
We just want to ensure

113
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,337
that she actually had depression!

114
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:55,422
Excuse me!

115
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,132
Are you telling the candidate
for the Ministry of Justice

116
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,341
to break the law?

117
00:11:58,425 --> 00:11:59,801
Please be quiet!

118
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,553
This is an interview for Mr. Woo!

119
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,596
Ask questions, then! Why the hell
are you telling him to break the law?

120
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,265
"The hell"? Who do you think you are?

121
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:06,391
How long have you been a politician?

122
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:08,309
What?

123
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:09,477
FALSIFICATION OF THE ADDRESS
FOR HIS DAUGHTER

124
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:15,775
Mr. Woo

125
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:18,111
during your time
as a presidential secretary

126
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:20,029
you left your stocks
with your brother-in-law

127
00:12:20,113 --> 00:12:21,614
and retrieved them, correct?

128
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:24,284
In other words, this is stock parking!

129
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,998
It's not appropriate for me to speak

130
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,875
upon a matter in investigation.

131
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:35,170
You remember

132
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,464
talking to your friends about stocks

133
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:38,673
back then, don't you?

134
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,800
I have no recollection of that.

135
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:47,515
We requested your wife's history
of stock exchanges

136
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,684
but you refused, correct?

137
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:53,980
I didn't think I needed to submit
personal information.

138
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:55,899
Aren't you admitting to the allegations

139
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:59,027
by refusing to submit the documents?

140
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,404
Ms. Park, stop assuming things.

141
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,364
Our people can't accept his explanations

142
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:04,991
when he keeps acting dumb
about the obvious!

143
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:07,452
Don't attack him without proof.

144
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:08,912
Does this look like a podcast to you?

145
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,288
Please be quiet!

146
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:12,248
How can he be the Minister of Justice

147
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,459
when he can't even answer these questions?

148
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,763
A STRONG POLITICIAN
TO MAKE NAMMYEON DISTRICT GREAT!

149
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,183
What brings you here?

150
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:32,977
I'm Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo
from the Central Prosecutors' Office.

151
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:34,896
Please begin.

152
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:35,980
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:37,148
What are you doing?

154
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,775
Please back up.

155
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,151
Please get out.

156
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:43,822
Take everything here as well.

157
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:55,458
THE PROSECUTION IS ON A SEARCH AND SEIZURE
AT THE DISTRICT OFFICE

158
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,503
I'll issue an arrest warrant
once the session is over

159
00:13:58,586 --> 00:13:59,963
so tell him to stick around.

160
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:02,340
- Text him.
- Okay.

161
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,093
Alright, let's go!

162
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,390
The prosecution is on a search and seizure
at the district office.

163
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:26,739
Mr. Woo, you keep beating around the bush.

164
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:28,408
Kim Jin-a went after Jang Tae-sik

165
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,451
as soon as she became a prosecutor.

166
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,370
Please speak.

167
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,876
I can answer any questions
about allegations against me.

168
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:38,960
However

169
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,713
I don't think it's appropriate

170
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:43,756
to speak about my family at this hearing.

171
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,592
Hurry, Prosecutor Kim.

172
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:50,847
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A

173
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:55,560
What's this?

174
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:57,979
A part of the set.

175
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:00,106
Do your thing with this, too.

176
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:01,566
You're the only one

177
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,568
I can trust.

178
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:06,571
Lies.

179
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:14,537
Bust Woo Hee-young and stop her daddy
from becoming the Minister.

180
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,497
I'm the mastermind behind it.

181
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,169
A no-name judge getting
the whole prosecution in action?

182
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:23,212
That's also got to be a lie.

183
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:28,176
Man.

184
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,227
Mr. Baek.

185
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:39,729
Yes?

186
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:42,815
Let's go.

187
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:44,275
Where?

188
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,903
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE'S OFFICE
SPECIAL ACTIVITIES REPORT

189
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,453
Hello?

190
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,664
I'm Kang Jeong-tae.

191
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:02,669
I need to speak to you

192
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:05,171
one on one.

193
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:10,677
Yes.

194
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,679
I'm heading to Mr. Kang's office
right now.

195
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:15,598
My prosecutor instincts tell me
he wants to make a deal.

196
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:17,684
I'll need to see what he's offering.

197
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,769
Let's go together. It could be a trap.

198
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:22,105
People can't mess
with the prosecutors of Korea that easily.

199
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:25,566
Fieldwork is for prosecutors,
not for judges.

200
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,693
Bye, then.

201
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,487
Mr. Park. Mr. Park!

202
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:40,999
I'M KANG JEONG-TAE.
I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU, ONE ON ONE.

203
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:51,300
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE

204
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:09,777
Yes, Mr. Kang.

205
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:11,988
Still no updates on Gyo-hun?

206
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,240
He'll go down before midnight.

207
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:15,742
Why don't we wait together?

208
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,955
Why? Something wrong?

209
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,833
No, sir. Where should I meet you?

210
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,334
Come to my office.

211
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,128
Yes, sir.

212
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:34,635
PROSECUTOR PARK CHEOL-WOO
OF THE CHUNGNAM PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

213
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:37,930
Please pick up.

214
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:41,809
PROSECUTOR PARK CHEOL-WOO
OF THE CHUNGNAM PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

215
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,643
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG
OF THE CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

216
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:27,438
FACTS REGARDING STOCK PARKING ALLEGATIONS

217
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,901
I think we've done enough talking now.

218
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:34,320
Do you have anything more to say?

219
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:36,364
Come on. It's getting late.

220
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,282
Let's call it a day now.

221
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:51,087
Alright, everyone, freeze!

222
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,425
As of this moment,
I'm arresting everyone here

223
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:58,970
for violations
of the Narcotics Control Act.

224
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:03,891
- Wake up.
- You have the right to an attorney

225
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:05,893
and to make a statement.

226
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:09,730
You may request a review of legality...

227
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:14,110
What are you doing? How did you get in?

228
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:16,904
Oh, you're Prosecutor Kim Jin-a, right?

229
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,366
Nice to meet you.

230
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:24,370
I'm Song Na-yeon,
a reporter at Daejin Daily.

231
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,417
Judge Lee told me that I'd see you

232
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,377
if I just camped out here.

233
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:34,255
Oh.

234
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:38,050
Let's wrap it up now.

235
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:41,929
CABINET MINISTER NOMINEE

236
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:48,936
What?

237
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,396
EMERGENCY ARREST OF THE DAUGHTER
OF WOO GYO-HUN, THE MINISTER NOMINEE

238
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:53,774
It's an emergency arrest!

239
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:57,528
I knew it
when he kept defending his family.

240
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:59,447
There's no way he can get out of this.

241
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,490
What a nice little daughter he has, huh?

242
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:06,204
AN JI-HUN, CHIEF OF STAFF

243
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,831
EMERGENCY ARREST OF THE DAUGHTER
OF WOO GYO-HUN, THE MINISTER NOMINEE

244
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:10,750
A RAID INTO A VIP CLUB
BUSTING SMUGGLED DRUGS

245
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:23,054
Mr. President...

246
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:25,014
Please!

247
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:27,141
Please! Please...

248
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:35,024
WOO GYO-HUN

249
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:37,610
Your call cannot be completed.
Please leave a message...

250
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,655
What the hell do I do?

251
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:48,454
WOO GYO-HUN

252
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:58,881
Your call cannot be completed.
Please leave a message...

253
00:20:59,131 --> 00:21:01,759
Why isn't he picking up?

254
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:04,345
MR. PRESIDENT PARK GWANG-TO

255
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:09,475
Mr. President!

256
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:11,477
Please help me out.

257
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,645
Please stop the press...

258
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:13,980
Thanks for your hard work.

259
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:16,774
I'm sure you'll find other ways
to serve the nation.

260
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,319
Mr. President!

261
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:21,696
Mr. President!

262
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,324
Oh, I found him!

263
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:27,451
- Come this way!
- Over here.

264
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,120
- It's Gyo-hun.
- Mr. Woo!

265
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:30,371
Mr. Woo.

266
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:32,748
- What do you have to say?
- Please explain!

267
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:41,173
Stop it!

268
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:44,302
MINISTER NOMINEE WOO GYO-HUN'S DAUGHTER
ARRESTED FOR DRUG CHARGES

269
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:19,045
Woo Hee-young, the daughter
of Justice Minister nominee Woo Gyo-hun

270
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:21,589
is under arrest for drug use.

271
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:25,468
The prosecution arrested Ms. Woo
and her party

272
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,803
at a VIP room of a club in Gangnam
last night.

273
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:31,015
Good work.

274
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:36,479
I have a question.

275
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,277
Why did you bring Mr. Woo down?

276
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,864
He doesn't know how to respect others.

277
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:49,867
Is that the only reason?

278
00:22:50,242 --> 00:22:51,744
He's also incredibly arrogant.

279
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:55,122
Really?

280
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,166
I can't accept such a jerk

281
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:59,627
becoming the Minister of Justice.

282
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,923
Why? Do I need to have a better reason?

283
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:05,216
No.

284
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:09,720
Getting a Justice Minister nominee shunned
from society is easy

285
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:11,138
for someone like Sin-jin.

286
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:13,641
But where does that power come from?

287
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:17,812
Oh.

288
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:20,439
Do you still not want anything in return?

289
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:22,358
No, not yet.

290
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,777
Not yet?

291
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,405
I'll wait, then.

292
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:29,698
Oh.

293
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:32,910
You know Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo, right?

294
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,580
He moved to Seoul with you?

295
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,084
Yes.

296
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:44,755
You've even cracked down
on a case together.

297
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:47,550
Are you two close?

298
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,135
No, sir.

299
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:52,596
We just happened to work together once.

300
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:54,723
Is that so?

301
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,352
Glad to hear that.

302
00:23:59,478 --> 00:24:01,230
I'm heading to Mr. Kang's office
right now.

303
00:24:01,313 --> 00:24:04,275
My prosecutor instincts tell me
he wants to make a deal.

304
00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:06,152
I'll need to see what he's offering.

305
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,988
Prosecutor Park is in danger.

306
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,952
DAEHAN CENTRAL PARTY
KANG JEONG-TAE'S DISTRICT OFFICE

307
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:18,622
Mr. Kang Jeong-tae?

308
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:38,142
Mr. Kang?

309
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:49,945
Jeong-tae seems to have contacted
Prosecutor Park.

310
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:53,032
It wasn't a coincidence
that Sin-jin called me.

311
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:56,160
Knowing he'll be at risk
once Mayor Chu rats him out.

312
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,162
That's just how it is in politics.

313
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,876
What do you think Prosecutor Park will do?

314
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,796
Team up with Jeong-tae?

315
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:12,009
Or not?

316
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:35,199
I really wonder

317
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:40,329
why you approached me.

318
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:57,596
Actually

319
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:02,768
I do want something in return.

320
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:10,484
Oh, you finally want something now?

321
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,862
There's only one way to save Mr. Park
and get through this situation.

322
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:21,579
Help me take down Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

323
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:24,540
What?

324
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:26,709
I approached you

325
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:29,253
because I wanted to take him down.

326
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:35,926
It's over now.

327
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:55,362
The court hereby orders
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

328
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:58,574
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

329
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,580
The Defendant has one week to appeal

330
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:06,457
to the court's decision
from the day of the announcement.

331
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:08,959
If an appeal is not filed

332
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:12,838
the decision will be carried out
as announced.

333
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,889
Right, I remember that.

334
00:27:25,684 --> 00:27:27,061
That was you.

335
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:35,152
I figured I'd need your power on my side

336
00:27:35,986 --> 00:27:38,656
to get Justice Hwang.

337
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:43,285
So, that was why you dragged Gyo-hun down

338
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:44,703
as I asked.

339
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,248
I wanted to get on your good side.

340
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:53,337
People change for a reason.

341
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:57,925
Your change came
with a desire for revenge.

342
00:27:58,717 --> 00:27:59,843
This is embarrassing.

343
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:03,681
Don't be ashamed
of your desire for revenge.

344
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:04,807
It's strength.

345
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,227
A motivation to strengthen yourself.

346
00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:11,563
Would you have become

347
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:13,982
such a great judge
without your desire for revenge?

348
00:28:17,736 --> 00:28:19,154
But you know

349
00:28:22,491 --> 00:28:24,868
I was also one of the judges
in court that day.

350
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:28,038
Did you know that?

351
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,752
You were the associate on his right.

352
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:38,674
You must be mad at me, too, then.

353
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:43,512
Judge Hwang's ruling was

354
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:47,599
blatantly biased
in favor of S Construction.

355
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:50,436
The associates

356
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:54,022
both on the right and the left,
wouldn't have had a say in it.

357
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,287
I'm hungry.

358
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:27,306
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

359
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:32,478
I thought Mr. Kim Jin-han was

360
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:34,938
your only friend, Mr. Kang.

361
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:36,815
But you made another one.

362
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:38,609
Do we look close?

363
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:42,404
Gosh, I don't know what to say about that.

364
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:47,034
Mr. Kang is a good man.

365
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:48,452
Please be good to him.

366
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:50,621
This is my bribe.

367
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:53,248
It's good stuff.

368
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,710
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your food.

369
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,759
I was less than ten years old

370
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:08,847
when I left the orphanage
and became a literal beggar.

371
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:14,978
One day, I was rummaging
through a restaurant's garbage dump

372
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,107
when a woman covered in makeup
called me over.

373
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:27,115
That was the start of it all.

374
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:32,871
I started cleaning and running errands
for a high-end hostess bar

375
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:36,416
in exchange for food.

376
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:40,587
I made a whole lot of food

377
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:43,048
to raise Sin-jin.

378
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:19,918
Go ahead. Eat.

379
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:57,289
Let's taste the bribe, then.

380
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:08,258
You're right.

381
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:12,512
Nam-yong had ties

382
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:15,849
to Jang Tae-sik at S Construction
at that time.

383
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:19,353
And Tae-sik is now the CEO of S Shopping.

384
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:22,356
What's your plan now?

385
00:32:23,482 --> 00:32:25,734
Corporations prioritize profit.

386
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,320
Whether it was right or wrong

387
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,906
Mr. Jang just did his best at his job.

388
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:31,990
However

389
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:34,743
Justice Hwang

390
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,121
went against his duty

391
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:41,792
to sentence my father to jail.

392
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,467
There will be a new Chief Justice soon.

393
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:57,808
Stay by my side,
and you'll see and hear a whole lot.

394
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:09,277
I can do it.

395
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:10,362
It's fine.

396
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,953
When the new Chief Justice is named

397
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:21,623
I'll toss Nam-yong to you.

398
00:33:26,753 --> 00:33:27,754
Thank you, sir.

399
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:34,636
Anything else you're hiding from me?

400
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:36,888
No, sir.

401
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:43,520
Good, and it better stay that way.

402
00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:45,689
I'll keep that in mind.

403
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:51,737
What are you doing?

404
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:53,155
Sorry?

405
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:55,073
She'll get mad
if you don't finish the food.

406
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:56,241
Oh.

407
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:59,244
It's like you've barely touched the food.

408
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:08,003
It's so tender and tasty.

409
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,259
DAEHAN CENTRAL PARTY
KANG JEONG-TAE'S DISTRICT OFFICE

410
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:23,435
Are you okay?

411
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:44,706
Am I?

412
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:49,127
I told you over the phone.

413
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:17,739
Mr. Kang...

414
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:44,057
Let's go together.

415
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,350
It could be a trap.

416
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:50,981
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG
OF THE CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

417
00:35:51,064 --> 00:35:53,692
Where were you, then? You said you'd come.

418
00:35:55,193 --> 00:35:56,194
I had dinner.

419
00:35:57,946 --> 00:36:00,073
I almost choked to death!

420
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:02,868
And you were stuffing your face?

421
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:06,830
I told you we should come here together.
I said it could be a trap.

422
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:08,957
Why didn't you come if you thought so?

423
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,544
"Fieldwork is for prosecutors,
not for judges!"

424
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:14,629
You really...

425
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:16,464
You always have to have the last word!

426
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:20,427
My neck hurts so much.

427
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,179
Seriously...

428
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,436
I'm so glad you're alive.

429
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:40,447
You make it sound
like we're close friends or something.

430
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,158
What? I thought we were friends.
Was I wrong?

431
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:44,492
Stop it.

432
00:36:46,953 --> 00:36:48,455
Call the police.

433
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:51,666
Just don't tell them I was here.

434
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,461
Why not?

435
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,841
How would you explain why I was here?

436
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:02,344
They might find out

437
00:37:02,427 --> 00:37:04,554
that we colluded to bring Jeong-tae down.

438
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:05,931
Colluded? What do you mean?

439
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,683
I was just doing my job
as the prosecutor on this case.

440
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:11,519
I was the one who handed over Yong-jin.

441
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:13,772
And the kickback ledger.

442
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:28,286
Is this the police?

443
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:39,589
Oh, my gosh!

444
00:37:39,673 --> 00:37:41,383
Hop in. I'll drive you to the junkyard.

445
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:44,844
- Really?
- No, let's just walk!

446
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:46,471
You can't get stuck in traffic.

447
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:48,098
There's no traffic yet.

448
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:49,891
- Right?
- No!

449
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:51,142
Just go to work now.

450
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:53,103
A judge can't be late to work.

451
00:37:53,186 --> 00:37:54,521
Aren't I right, honey?

452
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:57,649
You're right.
A judge shouldn't embarrass himself.

453
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:00,694
People bring everything to the junk yard.

454
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:02,445
Why not an old car?

455
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:03,530
Should I get you a car?

456
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:05,907
Forget it. You don't make that much.

457
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,659
See you later!

458
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:10,370
Boss, are you heading to work?

459
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:14,749
Do you want me to get you a bicycle?

460
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,584
Forget it.

461
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:20,297
- Let's go.
- You should walk more.

462
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:41,693
Give me whatever proof or witness you have
against Tae-sik.

463
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:43,903
You still think you can use
proof or a witness

464
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,905
to arrest Tae-sik?

465
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:48,575
You arrested him in an emergency arrest
and let him go.

466
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:50,452
Did you do that because you lacked proof?

467
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:54,622
I didn't arrest Woo Hee-young

468
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:56,750
just because you told me to.

469
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:59,878
I was ordered to arrest her, anyway.

470
00:39:00,545 --> 00:39:02,714
With a trash bag or something?

471
00:39:02,797 --> 00:39:03,882
How did you know that?

472
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:06,051
I told you I was the mastermind behind it.

473
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:10,555
A no-name judge getting
the whole prosecution in action?

474
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:12,015
You expect me to believe that?

475
00:39:12,098 --> 00:39:14,434
Who's got your back, really?

476
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:16,686
Do they also have the prosecution
in their hands?

477
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:24,569
Yeah, I may have planned all of this

478
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:27,822
but someone did order me to do it.

479
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:30,784
Who?

480
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:34,913
He tampers with evidence,
removes witnesses

481
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:37,624
and takes bribes to rule
in favor of people in court.

482
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:43,088
They must be behind Tae-sik
being released, too, then.

483
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:46,591
Tell me who it is.

484
00:39:48,802 --> 00:39:51,054
He's the devil of the Judiciary.

485
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:54,099
You'll need to put your life on the line

486
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,393
and get to the very bottom of it

487
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:58,395
if you choose to take them on.

488
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:06,319
You getting out?

489
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:12,117
Defendant Chu Yong-jin

490
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,828
used Taemyeong Construction
under his power

491
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:17,705
to illegally secure
publicly-funded projects

492
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,499
and carry out substandard work.

493
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:35,473
Had I gotten Jeong-tae in my hand

494
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:39,936
I would've made your life a bed of roses.

495
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:44,357
Why don't you have some?

496
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,192
You can eat it all.

497
00:40:50,488 --> 00:40:53,992
My dear Jeong-tae.

498
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:57,245
He was going to die for nothing, anyway.

499
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:00,498
Why did he have to give me
such a hard time

500
00:41:00,957 --> 00:41:03,585
to rake in all that money?

501
00:41:04,752 --> 00:41:07,422
Both with Taemyeong Construction
and the slush funds

502
00:41:07,505 --> 00:41:09,966
my only crime is that I did as I was told.

503
00:41:11,176 --> 00:41:13,928
In the end, the dead can't speak.

504
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:16,639
I'll have your back

505
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:18,808
all through the investigations.

506
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:20,393
Let's be a good team, alright?

507
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:28,193
I hear you know him.

508
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:32,197
Wow, it smells nice in here.

509
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:36,618
Nice to be alive and eating, huh?

510
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:39,287
Hmm?

511
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:44,459
don't you dare lay a finger on him,
or else...

512
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:46,002
You!

513
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:51,090
Have a seat.

514
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:57,013
Who the hell are you?

515
00:41:57,138 --> 00:41:59,140
To start, go to the prosecution
for your investigation.

516
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:01,267
We've met in court.

517
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:05,480
You fooled me
into thinking you were a loanshark.

518
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:07,482
Defendant Chu Yong-jin.

519
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:11,402
Who killed Mr. Kang Jeong-tae?

520
00:42:11,736 --> 00:42:13,404
- And why?
- No idea.

521
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:14,781
It wasn't me.

522
00:42:14,864 --> 00:42:17,492
You've given him almost ten billion won.

523
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,160
Did Jeong-tae really spend it alone?

524
00:42:20,662 --> 00:42:22,539
They cut Jeong-tae off

525
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:24,457
after seeing you side
with the prosecution.

526
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:26,125
To make sure it doesn't get to them.

527
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:27,627
It's all done, then.

528
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,713
No, my trial only begins now.

529
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,133
The sinkhole in the Nammyeon District.

530
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:36,553
The sinkhole was caused

531
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:38,805
by Taemyeong Construction's poor work.

532
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:41,683
And the real mastermind
behind Taemyeong is Chu Yong-jin.

533
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:43,393
And Chu Yong-jin

534
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:45,728
threatened the bereaved family
of a dead victim

535
00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:47,146
to sign a settlement.

536
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,190
Oh, let's leave out the 100 million won
you paid.

537
00:42:49,274 --> 00:42:51,651
You coerced them to settle
without even paying them.

538
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:52,735
Why would I admit to that?

539
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:55,280
Or the press will immediately report

540
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:58,116
on how you delivered slush funds
to Kang Jeong-tae

541
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:00,285
and how you'll tell the prosecution

542
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,371
about where the funds went.

543
00:43:03,454 --> 00:43:04,831
Then, how long would it take

544
00:43:05,623 --> 00:43:08,585
for them
to try to choke you to death again?

545
00:43:09,794 --> 00:43:11,129
I didn't do any of that.

546
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,256
Right.

547
00:43:13,631 --> 00:43:16,301
But when the media says so,
that's what everyone will believe.

548
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:20,388
Are you

549
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,974
taking his side right now?

550
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:25,310
The bastard whose son died
in the sinkhole?

551
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:26,394
Yeah.

552
00:43:26,477 --> 00:43:29,564
But he's not a bastard.
He’s a grieving father!

553
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:31,482
A grieving father!

554
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:42,535
I know.

555
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:45,496
And I feel terrible about it.

556
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:48,207
You think I expected such an accident?

557
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,834
I'll give them more compensation

558
00:43:49,917 --> 00:43:51,878
and sincerely apologize to them.

559
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:54,255
- So...
- Don't say anything.

560
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:55,840
Don't apologize

561
00:43:55,923 --> 00:43:58,551
and don't act sad and apologetic
around people, either.

562
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,346
Don't even look down.

563
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:02,972
Show the world

564
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:05,725
who you really are.

565
00:44:05,808 --> 00:44:06,809
Or else

566
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,812
you'll get strangled again.

567
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:14,192
The Defendant's greed did not stop there.

568
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:16,861
He ordered or allowed
substandard constructions

569
00:44:16,944 --> 00:44:18,738
and blatantly ignored the people's safety

570
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:20,323
to make profit illegally.

571
00:44:20,406 --> 00:44:22,700
This is an abuse of power,
occupational breach of trust

572
00:44:22,784 --> 00:44:24,243
and coercion.

573
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:25,870
And unfortunately

574
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:29,749
this led to a death
of an innocent man in his twenties.

575
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,634
Not only that,
but he also tried to hide his wrongs

576
00:44:39,717 --> 00:44:42,303
by coercing the victims to settle.

577
00:44:43,638 --> 00:44:45,682
The Defendant sought personal gain

578
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:48,017
at the expense of an innocent life

579
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:50,269
which is unforgivable.

580
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,439
Therefore, the prosecution requests
Defendant Chu Yong-jin

581
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:55,316
to be imprisoned for ten years

582
00:44:56,234 --> 00:44:59,070
with a fine of five billion won.
That is all.

583
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:24,011
You know who killed Assemblyman Kang,
don't you?

584
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,221
No.

585
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:26,764
The day he died

586
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:29,100
you warned me, saying it could be a trap.

587
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:30,935
Doesn't that mean you knew something?

588
00:45:31,018 --> 00:45:33,771
No, I was just trying to warn you.

589
00:45:35,022 --> 00:45:36,190
Liar.

590
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:38,985
The prosecution did a search and seizure
of Taemyeong Construction

591
00:45:39,068 --> 00:45:43,072
which exposed a corrupt politician
who had no regard for people's lives.

592
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:44,949
The investigation team stated

593
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:47,827
that Taemyeong received
large sums of money in rebate

594
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,787
in the process of securing public projects

595
00:45:49,871 --> 00:45:53,958
and that they completely ignored
safety regulations.

596
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:58,004
Amidst the growing anger and sadness
in public

597
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:00,047
people are still visiting the sinkhole

598
00:46:00,131 --> 00:46:02,216
to pay respect to the young man

599
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,344
who died in the unfortunate incident.

600
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:07,889
SAFETY FIRST

601
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,835
BAMTOL, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN HEAVEN

602
00:47:07,865 --> 00:47:08,908
Thank you.

603
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:10,284
REST IN PEACE, MR. HEO MIN-GU

604
00:47:10,368 --> 00:47:13,412
My son can finally rest in peace.

605
00:47:16,374 --> 00:47:19,043
I hope your hearts can also be at peace.

606
00:47:20,002 --> 00:47:21,045
I'm sure

607
00:47:22,463 --> 00:47:24,006
Min-gu wants that for you, too.

608
00:47:38,396 --> 00:47:40,898
I looked into Mayor Chu's case,
as you asked.

609
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:44,694
The investigation on the slush fund
stopped at Mr. Kang Jeong-tae.

610
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,155
Whatever big hand is behind this

611
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:51,033
I guess even a third-term politician was
merely a pawn.

612
00:47:52,368 --> 00:47:54,328
He's the devil of the Judiciary.

613
00:47:55,162 --> 00:47:58,082
You'll need to put your life on the line.

614
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:02,962
Judge Lee.

615
00:48:04,797 --> 00:48:07,216
Seems like you've already put your life
on the line.

616
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:14,599
On today's agenda, we have the selection
of the next Chief Justice.

617
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:16,225
Unfortunately

618
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:19,645
the President one-sidedly nominated
Jeon Heung-woo

619
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:21,689
which has brought chaos to the Judiciary.

620
00:48:21,772 --> 00:48:23,190
It's about time we get rid of him.

621
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:26,319
Since this is about the Judiciary...

622
00:48:26,694 --> 00:48:29,739
I'd like to suggest
Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

623
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:33,200
What about the confirmation hearing?

624
00:48:33,868 --> 00:48:36,203
It went smoothly
when he was a Justice nominee.

625
00:48:36,287 --> 00:48:37,872
Don't make him into another Gyo-hun.

626
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:40,583
I'll make sure.

627
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:05,358
Sir.

628
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:24,377
Chairman Jang Yong-hyeon will be
over the moon

629
00:49:25,002 --> 00:49:27,213
if Nam-yong becomes the Chief Justice.

630
00:49:28,047 --> 00:49:30,383
They've been making deals
for over 20 years, right?

631
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,469
And CEO Jang Tae-sik as well,
since his days at S Construction.

632
00:49:35,012 --> 00:49:38,307
Like father, like son.
They're milking him for two generations.

633
00:49:39,392 --> 00:49:41,268
If Nam-yong becomes the Chief Justice

634
00:49:41,352 --> 00:49:43,521
you'll get to choose the Chairperson
and the Election Commissioners

635
00:49:43,604 --> 00:49:45,564
for the National Election Commission.

636
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,316
As I should.

637
00:49:49,443 --> 00:49:52,488
Oh, is Gyo-hun still out there?

638
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:10,464
Mr. Kang.

639
00:50:10,548 --> 00:50:12,800
Your daughter will be released
on probation.

640
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,177
Is that what His Excellency wants?

641
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:16,929
You'll be under investigation

642
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,472
for allegations of stock parking.

643
00:50:18,556 --> 00:50:19,557
What?

644
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,851
A civic group filed a complaint about it,
after all.

645
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:24,895
That was just for formality!

646
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:26,814
The law is all about formality.

647
00:50:28,107 --> 00:50:30,276
Rules created by humans
to respect the bare minimum.

648
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,658
I have to talk to His Excellency.

649
00:50:37,742 --> 00:50:39,160
Don't bother.

650
00:50:39,994 --> 00:50:40,995
Get out of my way.

651
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,165
What are you doing?

652
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:48,419
You want me to turn your daughter
into a drug dealer?

653
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,129
What did you just say?

654
00:50:52,214 --> 00:50:54,884
How about stock price manipulation
instead of stock parking?

655
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:56,218
You little...

656
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:12,693
Why are you doing this to me?

657
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:16,405
Do you know
why your wife's drivers keep quitting?

658
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:43,933
I've learned people's backgrounds
don't always reflect their characters.

659
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:50,397
His Excellency has a message for you,
along with this.

660
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:53,984
"Going forward, whatever it is"

661
00:51:54,568 --> 00:51:57,279
"there must not be a single mistake."

662
00:51:58,531 --> 00:51:59,532
That's right.

663
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:02,326
Going forward is always the problem.

664
00:52:03,577 --> 00:52:05,871
So, going forward, come when I call you

665
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:08,165
and leave

666
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:10,126
when I tell you.

667
00:52:13,504 --> 00:52:15,005
Don't ask me any questions

668
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:21,971
about what I order you to do.

669
00:52:23,722 --> 00:52:26,267
And don't make a single mistake.

670
00:52:30,938 --> 00:52:32,982
Then, you'll get to protect

671
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:35,484
your precious little family

672
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:40,114
and keep your assemblyman badge
in the next election.

673
00:52:44,785 --> 00:52:45,828
So...

674
00:53:07,808 --> 00:53:09,310
Chief Justice Jeon Heung-woo.

675
00:53:10,102 --> 00:53:11,187
Let's take him down.

676
00:53:22,781 --> 00:53:24,992
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

677
00:53:25,075 --> 00:53:29,538
I'D LIKE TO EXPOSE
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON HEUNG-WOO

678
00:53:29,622 --> 00:53:32,124
I DEMAND CHIEF JUSTICE JEON TO STEP DOWN

679
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:35,294
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON'S ONE-SIDED REFORM IS
A THREAT TO THE JUDICIARY

680
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:37,546
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON MUST STEP DOWN

681
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,298
STOP PURGING PEOPLE
AND LEAVE THE SUPREME COURT

682
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:41,050
DON'T STAY SILENT.
JOIN US IN TAKING DOWN CHIEF JUSTICE JEON

683
00:53:42,801 --> 00:53:44,345
POST

684
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:45,763
YOUR JUNIOR JUDGES WON'T STAY SILENT.
THE SUPREME COURT ISN'T YOUR LAB.

685
00:53:45,846 --> 00:53:47,139
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON, PLEASE LEAVE.
THE SUPREME COURT ISN'T YOUR PLAYGROUND.

686
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:52,228
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON HEUNG-WOO

687
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:59,318
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

688
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:01,111
It caused quite a stir.

689
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:04,823
How's the press reacting?

690
00:54:05,032 --> 00:54:07,743
I've contacted a few news outlets
facing lawsuits.

691
00:54:07,826 --> 00:54:09,787
They'll publish
a wave of articles tomorrow.

692
00:54:10,287 --> 00:54:13,207
He should go down in about a week or so.

693
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,085
He's tough. He grew up on the streets.

694
00:54:17,044 --> 00:54:19,213
He could last a month,
even while barely hanging on.

695
00:54:20,673 --> 00:54:23,425
Okay, I'll find another way, then.

696
00:54:24,051 --> 00:54:25,302
No, there's no need to hurry.

697
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,222
Let's wear him down first
before we tear him apart.

698
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:30,266
Yes, sir.

699
00:54:31,016 --> 00:54:33,644
Who's the next Chief Justice after him?

700
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:43,821
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON,
THE JUDICIARY IS NOT YOURS.

701
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:45,489
THIS WAS NOT THE REFORM WE WANTED.

702
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:47,116
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON DESTROYED
JUSTICE IN THE JUDICIARY.

703
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:48,909
I'D LIKE TO EXPOSE CHIEF JUSTICE JEON.

704
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:50,536
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON,
PLEASE LEAVE THE SUPREME COURT.

705
00:54:55,582 --> 00:54:56,917
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON HEUNG-WOO

706
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:58,127
Chief Justice Jeon resigns

707
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,421
before the month is even over.

708
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:02,006
HWANG NAM-YONG

709
00:55:02,089 --> 00:55:03,257
Who's going to replace him?

710
00:55:18,856 --> 00:55:21,025
HWANG NAM-YONG

711
00:55:21,108 --> 00:55:22,318
Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

712
00:55:26,697 --> 00:55:28,198
Clear your schedule for tonight.

713
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:30,034
We need to go somewhere.

714
00:55:30,284 --> 00:55:31,368
Yes, sir.

715
00:55:42,046 --> 00:55:43,630
Yeah, it's Judge Lee.

716
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,092
I'm taking him to my meeting
with Nam-yong.

717
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:49,636
Mr. Kang

718
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:53,098
Judge Lee isn't one of us yet.

719
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:57,186
That's presumptuous of you again.

720
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,609
I know.

721
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:06,362
The only one I trust around here...

722
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,241
Do I really have to tell you?

723
00:56:12,785 --> 00:56:13,786
Sorry, sir.

724
00:56:23,087 --> 00:56:24,838
Call Seong-dae, the presiding judge.

725
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:27,091
He'll join us this evening.

726
00:56:27,508 --> 00:56:29,093
Yes, sir.

727
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:34,807
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-HAN

728
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:35,891
Come in.

729
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,066
You wanted to see me?

730
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,568
Yeah, have a seat.

731
00:56:49,446 --> 00:56:51,615
How's Judge Lee doing these days?

732
00:56:53,784 --> 00:56:54,785
Oh.

733
00:56:56,537 --> 00:56:58,330
He hasn't been up to much.

734
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:00,249
How is he with Yi-seok?

735
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,960
He's been called to his office
a few times.

736
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:07,089
- For what?
- Sorry?

737
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:08,966
Why was he summoned?

738
00:57:11,635 --> 00:57:13,554
I'm not sure about that.

739
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:17,015
What do you think?

740
00:57:17,808 --> 00:57:20,602
Does it look like Han-young is
on Yi-seok's side?

741
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:22,604
No, I doubt it.

742
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,609
But Yi-seok brought him to Seoul.

743
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:30,404
And he'll soon be
the Partner of Haenal's son-in-law.

744
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:35,367
Even so.

745
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:39,455
Han-young is such a nobody.

746
00:57:45,043 --> 00:57:46,253
Watch him carefully.

747
00:57:49,047 --> 00:57:51,175
How much did S Shopping pay you?

748
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:53,051
Three billion won.

749
00:57:54,678 --> 00:57:57,723
Listen to the discussion carefully
and get on it.

750
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:59,433
Yes, sir.

751
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:04,188
My, my!

752
00:58:05,105 --> 00:58:07,441
Sin-jin, it's been a real minute.

753
00:58:08,942 --> 00:58:11,570
JUSTICE HWANG NAM-YONG

754
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:14,781
MANWOL

755
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:16,867
I knew it was time when you called me.

756
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,161
And when I saw the mess
on the court's intranet.

757
00:58:19,703 --> 00:58:22,873
What do you get
out of my becoming Chief Justice?

758
00:58:29,796 --> 00:58:31,423
I get the leader of the Judiciary

759
00:58:32,216 --> 00:58:33,800
the Chief Justice on my side.

760
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:35,802
Is that right?

761
00:58:37,262 --> 00:58:40,432
I become the Chief Justice,
and you gain one on your side.

762
00:58:41,642 --> 00:58:43,143
That's a good deal for both of us.

763
00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:45,062
But

764
00:58:46,855 --> 00:58:49,775
there's no guarantee
that I won't become the next Heung-woo.

765
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:52,903
I was your associate back in the day.

766
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:54,863
I won't let that happen to you.

767
00:58:56,865 --> 00:58:58,242
I'd better trust you, huh?

768
00:58:59,493 --> 00:59:00,619
Of course.

769
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:03,330
Start by changing your car to a modest SUV

770
00:59:03,413 --> 00:59:04,998
and sell all your stocks.

771
00:59:05,082 --> 00:59:07,334
We'll make a few donations

772
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:09,086
under your name as well.

773
00:59:10,462 --> 00:59:13,215
You live in Gangcheon Palace
in Gangnam, right?

774
00:59:13,757 --> 00:59:16,635
Sell that and move
into a more humble apartment unit.

775
00:59:17,177 --> 00:59:18,178
Seong-dae is here

776
00:59:18,262 --> 00:59:20,806
to help you find a unit in Gangbuk
around 100 square meters.

777
00:59:22,516 --> 00:59:24,309
There's so much to do.

778
00:59:25,352 --> 00:59:26,520
Should I do anything?

779
00:59:26,603 --> 00:59:28,355
The younger judges are determined

780
00:59:28,814 --> 00:59:31,441
to overthrow Chief Justice Jeon.

781
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:33,277
Help them.

782
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:34,736
Okay.

783
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:38,282
It'd be a shame to set
a bad example to them.

784
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:41,159
Cheers.

785
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,758
Heung-woo will step down soon.

786
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:40,927
And I'll get Nam-yong to replace him.

787
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:44,014
As long as you toss him to me

788
01:00:44,097 --> 01:00:45,390
as you promised.

789
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,310
How much do you trust me?

790
01:00:52,064 --> 01:00:53,065
How much

791
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,442
do you trust me?

792
01:00:58,236 --> 01:00:59,446
How audacious of you.

793
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:13,752
We can't bring Nam-yong to trial.

794
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:16,171
But we can take his judge's robe.

795
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,467
Ending a Chief Justice's career is tougher
than your father's experience

796
01:01:21,009 --> 01:01:22,511
in prison.

797
01:01:23,303 --> 01:01:25,055
Didn't you say

798
01:01:25,597 --> 01:01:28,100
you've decided to make Nam-yong
the Chief Justice?

799
01:01:28,183 --> 01:01:29,393
Exactly.

800
01:01:31,561 --> 01:01:34,272
Which one of us do you think
can act faster?

801
01:01:36,066 --> 01:01:37,359
I wonder.

802
01:02:03,635 --> 01:02:04,636
Water.

803
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:09,725
Here.

804
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:13,228
What's this? A love letter?

805
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:14,563
Yeah, what else?

806
01:02:20,694 --> 01:02:22,028
Is someone looking for a job?

807
01:02:22,654 --> 01:02:23,697
JB DAEHAN CONSTRUCTION HIRING RESULTS

808
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,157
ALL FAILED APPLICANTS

809
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,867
Hey, this is...

810
01:02:28,994 --> 01:02:30,328
The lowest score on the exam

811
01:02:30,787 --> 01:02:32,289
but the highest score in the interview.

812
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,416
I'm not even surprised anymore.

813
01:02:36,168 --> 01:02:37,919
Who's this Hwang Tae-seong guy?

814
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:41,298
The son of the judge

815
01:02:41,381 --> 01:02:43,675
who was on my father's case 18 years ago.

816
01:02:45,802 --> 01:02:47,846
What? Hey! Han-young!

817
01:02:56,938 --> 01:02:58,940
The trial for Chu Yong-jin is now over.

818
01:03:00,066 --> 01:03:02,110
Sorry for not staying on the case
all the way.

819
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:05,947
No, a new indictment needs a new trial,
after all.

820
01:03:07,073 --> 01:03:09,493
He was exposed for using violence
against the victims.

821
01:03:09,576 --> 01:03:10,827
You didn't have a choice.

822
01:03:10,911 --> 01:03:13,121
Yes, good call.

823
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:14,206
And good job.

824
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:15,582
I'll continue to work harder.

825
01:03:22,214 --> 01:03:23,298
Do you

826
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:26,176
still hang out often
with Sin-jin these days?

827
01:03:27,594 --> 01:03:29,054
And eat together?

828
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:31,389
I'm just worried.

829
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:34,434
He has a bad reputation.

830
01:03:40,565 --> 01:03:41,775
Not only do we eat together

831
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:44,986
but we even drink together.

832
01:03:46,154 --> 01:03:47,155
What?

833
01:03:47,697 --> 01:03:48,782
Is that all?

834
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:53,161
He said he'd get me anything

835
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:55,497
as long as I did as I was told.

836
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:57,207
See?

837
01:03:57,707 --> 01:03:59,626
He's a very risky man to be around.

838
01:03:59,709 --> 01:04:01,586
Get you everything? How?

839
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:04,422
Never hang out with him again.

840
01:04:07,217 --> 01:04:08,385
Why are you quiet?

841
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:10,929
I already told him

842
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:12,806
what I wanted.

843
01:04:15,976 --> 01:04:17,811
- What?
- What is it?

844
01:04:18,436 --> 01:04:20,814
What is it that you want from Sin-jin?

845
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,235
Sorry.

846
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:27,737
What? Why are you sorry?

847
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:29,406
Tell him right now.

848
01:04:30,615 --> 01:04:31,616
Sorry.

849
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,080
I noticed that you got a new car.

850
01:04:37,956 --> 01:04:40,625
Is that what you wanted from Sin-jin?
A new car?

851
01:04:41,084 --> 01:04:43,044
No, I financed the new car myself.

852
01:04:44,087 --> 01:04:45,755
Are you lying to us now?

853
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:47,132
Hey!

854
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:52,429
Maybe work on your lying skills
before you try to lie.

855
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:56,725
I guess this is the end of our friendship.

856
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:15,201
See you again.

857
01:05:40,435 --> 01:05:41,811
This is the only chance

858
01:05:43,438 --> 01:05:46,316
to hunt Yi-seok,
the tiger of the Judiciary.

859
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:52,155
THE JUDGE RETURNS

860
01:06:16,638 --> 01:06:18,974
Lee Seong-dae's huge debt
came around this time.

861
01:06:19,057 --> 01:06:21,017
No! My 400 million won!

862
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:23,186
International investment frauds are
in Gangnam now.

863
01:06:23,311 --> 01:06:25,939
How can you make money off scammers?

864
01:06:26,022 --> 01:06:27,899
They build trust with you
by offering low interest rates

865
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:29,734
for about three months.

866
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:31,486
You cast the bait yourself

867
01:06:31,569 --> 01:06:33,113
so hunt him yourself, too.

868
01:06:33,196 --> 01:06:34,572
Whether it's legal or illegal.

869
01:06:34,656 --> 01:06:35,657
I'll do it my way.

870
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,909
If things go wrong later,
we won’t be able to deal with it.

871
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:39,661
Will you let me in
if I put my life on the line?

872
01:06:39,744 --> 01:06:41,788
- What? The prosecution?
- We've been tipped off

873
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:42,872
about some investment frauds around here.

874
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:44,165
They just got on the elevator.

875
01:06:44,374 --> 01:06:45,375
Hurry!

876
01:06:49,963 --> 01:06:51,965
