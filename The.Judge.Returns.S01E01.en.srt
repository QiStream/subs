[Episode 1]

7
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:06,480
The Seoul City Council has passed
its 18th ordinance of 2035, aimed at

8
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,774
improving urban aesthetics
and public safety

9
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:12,541
by removing homeless people from the streets.

10
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,709
Under the ordinance,
if homelessness is identified in major areas,

11
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,616
police or private security officers

12
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:20,202
are authorized to carry out immediate eviction.

13
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:23,497
It referred to as the
"urban homeless removal system."

14
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:24,956
As a result, homeless people

15
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:28,752
are being pushed into underground tunnels,
abandoned buildings, and storm drains.

16
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:31,797
Human rights groups are pushing back,
calling it an effort to erase people,

17
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,466
not provide welfare.

18
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:36,676
Three members of a family were found dead

19
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:39,888
in a semi-basement home in Hanyang City.

20
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,557
Inside the room with
no electricity or running water,

21
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:45,143
only a pizza box believed

22
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:48,543
to be the family's last meal was found.

23
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:51,369
Police say the parents,
driven by severe financial hardship,

24
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:52,818
killed their young son

25
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:56,004
before taking their own lives.

26
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:57,602
The room was piled with

27
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:59,991
overdue bills and scrap paper,

28
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:01,851
and the family's bank account was

29
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:04,329
reportedly empty.

30
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,123
The tragedy has sent
shockwaves through society,

31
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,875
as economic hardship

32
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,986
pushed a family to the brink.

Yes.

that should be fine.

Do you really... think this suits my mother?

[Yoo Se Hee,
Youngest Daughter of Haenal Law Firm]

I don't know.

338
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:47,565
Do I really have to think about all that?

339
00:27:48,488 --> 00:27:51,040
The receipt's inside, so whatever.

340
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:55,326
If she doesn't like it,
she can exchange it or take the cash.

341
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:58,001
Tell her to do whatever she wants.

342
00:27:58,001 --> 00:28:00,928
Either way, I did my duty as a daughter-in-law.

343
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:17,718
Yeah, I know.

344
00:28:17,718 --> 00:28:19,531
When it comes to being
a daughter-in-law in name only,

345
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,717
you're the best.

No!

Happy birthday.

351
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:50,540
I wondered why...

352
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,833
my birthday had to fall on a day like today.

353
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,646
Maybe it's because you were meant to come.

354
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,179
I'm glad you're here.

355

If you hadn't come,

I would've gone to you.

357
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,832
Of course I came. It's your birthday.

358
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:18,218
But where are you going?

The granddaughter downstairs took her own life.

pushed a dying person over the edge.

364
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:05,588
You know exactly who that damn judge is. Right?

365
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:07,178
Let's go.

366
00:31:07,178 --> 00:31:09,115
We should...

367
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:12,008
at least apologize to the living.

368
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:15,350
No.

369
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,018
I ruled according to the law.

370
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:18,676
So...

371
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,276
I have nothing to apologize for.

372
00:31:22,617 --> 00:31:24,227
You shouldn't go either.

373
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:25,462
Why?

374
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:28,446
Afraid I'll get grabbed by the hair
for being that your mom?

375
00:31:28,446 --> 00:31:31,243
You could get hurt for no reason.

376
00:31:31,243 --> 00:31:33,246
- Please don't go.
- You...

377
00:31:33,246 --> 00:31:36,024
Did you really judge that case fairly?

378
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:37,825
Yes.

379
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:43,999
Well...

380
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:45,567
This isn't something you figure out

381
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:47,585
by arguing it out.

382
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:50,311
If you're human, you just know.

383
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:53,971
Still...

384
00:31:56,803 --> 00:31:59,724
if you were truly fair,

385
00:31:59,724 --> 00:32:01,960
look me in the eye and say it again.

386
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,923
Like, "Mom."

387
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,866
"I judged the case fairly."

388
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:07,560
"I am a fair judge."

389
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,752
Then I'll believe you

390
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:11,646
and stand by you no matter what.

391
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:14,173
"My son is not some damn judge."

Isn't this costing more than it's worth?

and you are here instead?

Why did you come here alone?

If you're really sorry,

Among the documents the prosecution seized,

452

there's the embezzlement of
S Construction's funds, correct?

453

Embezzlement?

No, that money is all mine.

There are also documents showing slush funds

created using embezzled company money.

457

Slush funds and embezzlement...

00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:46,602
You haven't heard about him?

505
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:51,396
Looks like S group pulled some strings.

506
00:43:52,574 --> 00:43:54,375
Really?

507
00:43:55,152 --> 00:43:57,145
Dig into it. Now.

508
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:58,946
Yes.

509
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:09,966
Have some.

510
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,295
Please.

511
00:44:15,174 --> 00:44:17,233
It'll get cold.

512
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:26,826
You don't need to worry about your family.

513
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:31,388
I'm just saying it'll be harder if you refuse.

514
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:36,743
In detention.

515
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:38,836
Not here.

516
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:46,767
Hello, sir.

517
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:51,061
So you start at the Criminal Division

518
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:54,388
of the Seoul Central District Court tomorrow?

519
00:44:54,388 --> 00:44:55,580
Yeah, right.

520
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,381
All right.

521
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,942
Come to think of it,

522
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:04,620
Yoo Seon Cheol of Haenal Law Firm

523
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,506
seems to care about you quite a lot.

524
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:19,232
He's from a regional university,
and his training ranking was average.

525
00:45:19,232 --> 00:45:20,864
The year he started handling cases solo,

526
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:22,984
he married into Haenal Law Firm.

527
00:45:22,984 --> 00:45:24,308
From then on,

528
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:26,043
a front law firm Haenal set up,

529
00:45:26,043 --> 00:45:30,715
Gwangmin Law Firm,
has a one-hundred-percent win rate.

530
00:45:30,715 --> 00:45:34,313
They were all Judge Lee Han Young's cases.

531
00:45:34,313 --> 00:45:36,363
They didn't gain a son-in-law.

532
00:45:36,363 --> 00:45:38,083
They gained an ally.

533
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,151
That's probably why

534
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:40,677
he was the first in his class
to make presiding judge.

535
00:45:40,677 --> 00:45:41,870
What a bastard.

536
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,588
But aside from the Gwangmin cases,

537
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:46,657
his other rulings are considered
fairly balanced.

538
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:48,559
So not a complete bastard?

539
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:50,961
Lee Han Young's father has dementia.

540
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:53,308
He's in a nursing facility in Gwacheon.

541
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:55,436
Wow...

542
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:58,076
Do you know how much a year there costs?

543
00:45:58,076 --> 00:46:00,057
Two hundred million won.

544
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,084
The payments are from Yoo Se Hee.

545
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:04,228
It's Lee Han Young's wife.

546
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:08,381
Looks like he benefits plenty from his in-laws,

547
00:46:08,381 --> 00:46:10,763
but there's nothing in his own name.

548
00:46:10,763 --> 00:46:12,782
He must be stashing it somewhere.

549
00:46:12,782 --> 00:46:14,970
Any women? Gambling? Anything else?

550
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,935
He's a judge Haenal Law Firm has on a leash.

551
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:19,670
We need at least one weakness.

552
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,707
He's got two nicknames.

553
00:46:21,707 --> 00:46:24,532
One is "the in-laws' lapdog."

554
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:25,689
Ever seen servants get paid

555
00:46:25,689 --> 00:46:29,107
when the masters make deals?

556
00:46:29,107 --> 00:46:32,892
No woman trouble. No gambling either.

557
00:46:32,892 --> 00:46:34,383
Among bastards,

558
00:46:34,383 --> 00:46:36,598
he's the obedient kind.

559
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,154
Anything else?

560
00:46:40,154 --> 00:46:41,555
You said two nicknames.

561
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:42,886
Six-dot.

562
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:44,037
"Six-dot?"

563
00:46:44,037 --> 00:46:45,750
Sounds like gambling.

564
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,929
No, he doesn't gamble.

565
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:51,363
It's because he clocks out at six, sharp.

566
00:46:59,788 --> 00:47:02,463
Is that even possible for a Korean judge?

567
00:47:02,463 --> 00:47:05,049
Yes. He's Haenal's son-in-law.

568
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:06,760
That's why his caseload is...

569
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,060
kept reasonable.

570
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,557
Looks like you'll have to find
his weakness yourself, sir.

571
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:12,657
Hang up.

572
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,814
Hey, Number 522!

573
00:47:56,814 --> 00:47:58,615
Wake up!

574
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,897
What?

575
00:48:01,897 --> 00:48:04,483
How the hell...

576
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:06,360
did you botch the surveillance?

577
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,389
What do we do?

578
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:10,397
If this gets out,
they'll scream coercive investigation.

579
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:12,591
Should we slap an embargo
on the legal reporters first?

580
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,486
No.

581
00:48:14,486 --> 00:48:16,643
Leak it as a tip from a prosecution source,

582
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,462
that homicide is a possibility.

583
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:23,209
Then one of them will come
begging to save themselves.

584
00:48:45,616 --> 00:48:48,835
[50 million won]

585
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:11,126
Han Young?

586
00:49:12,422 --> 00:49:14,456
My dear son.

587
00:49:14,456 --> 00:49:16,950
You have to be a judge.

588
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:26,106
I became a judge a long time ago.

589
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:29,053
Why are you still saying that?

590
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:32,726
I don't even know
if I became a judge the way you wanted.

591
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:35,861
Your son is so kind.

592
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:40,436
You're Judge Lee Han Young, right?

593
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:41,821
I'm Prosecutor Kim Jin Ah...

594
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:44,809
from the Special Division
of the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

595
00:49:49,229 --> 00:49:51,374
We'll be seeing each other in court soon.

596
00:49:51,374 --> 00:49:54,695
You know, Chairman Jang Tae Sik of S Group...

597
00:49:54,695 --> 00:49:56,996
I'll be indicting him.

598
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,476
I stirred up S Group's reservoir,

599
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:03,287
and it looks like people up top panicked.

600
00:50:03,287 --> 00:50:06,064
They even pulled a judge from
the High Court's civil division

601
00:50:06,064 --> 00:50:08,890
into the criminal division.

602
00:50:12,954 --> 00:50:15,452
Fine. You can play dumb.

603
00:50:15,452 --> 00:50:17,620
But this time, let's do it by the book.

604
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,407
Otherwise, I'll start with you
and tear everything apart.

605
00:50:21,407 --> 00:50:23,956
I graduated second in my class
at Hankuk University Law School.

606
00:50:23,956 --> 00:50:27,759
I'm smart, and I've got a very nasty temper.

607
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:30,709
From what I see, you don't look that smart.

608
00:50:33,788 --> 00:50:37,095
Then I guess you admit the nasty temper part.

609
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:42,308
If you want to keep living
as your in-laws' lapdog,

610
00:50:42,308 --> 00:50:44,904
let's do it by the book this time.

611
00:50:44,904 --> 00:50:48,990
I'll request full transcripts
and audio recordings at trial.

612
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,627
Don't. I'll deny it.

613
00:50:51,627 --> 00:50:53,115
Why?

614
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:55,344
Nervous?

615
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,027
If you're nervous, you've already lost.

616
00:51:16,091 --> 00:51:17,259
Breaking news.

617
00:51:17,259 --> 00:51:20,517
Choi Jong Hak, CEO of S Construction,
who was under investigation,

618
00:51:20,517 --> 00:51:22,639
was found unconscious this morning

619
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:24,764
while in custody at the Seoul Detention Center.

620
00:51:24,764 --> 00:51:27,519
He was rushed to the hospital

621
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:29,661
but was later pronounced dead.

622
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:31,972
Police are currently investigating the case,

623
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:34,410
with suicide considered
the leading possibility.

624
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:37,821
Given that Choi was a key figure
in the prosecution's investigation...

625
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:39,239
CEO Choi Jong Hak...

626
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:40,741
didn't kill himself.

627
00:51:40,741 --> 00:51:42,479
There is growing speculation about

628
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:44,870
outside pressure or
possible third-party involvement.

629
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:47,568
Prosecutors have seized
internal off-the-books ledgers,

630
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:50,754
revealing illegal fund flows
worth trillions of won...

631
00:51:51,534 --> 00:51:53,323
Did you get anything out of him?

632
00:51:53,323 --> 00:51:54,555
No.

633
00:51:54,555 --> 00:51:56,748
I just warned him.

634
00:51:56,748 --> 00:51:58,863
Didn't seem to work.

635
00:51:58,863 --> 00:52:01,303
You should've at least blown up at him.

636
00:52:01,303 --> 00:52:02,888
Yeah.

637
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:05,308
I'm already regretting it.

638
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,338
Sir,

639
00:52:42,338 --> 00:52:44,388
can we expect a fair trial today?

640
00:52:44,388 --> 00:52:46,286
Will the death of the S Construction CEO

641
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:48,718
affect the ruling?

642
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:51,333
Sir,

643
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:54,026
just one comment please...

644
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:57,983
Please step back.

645
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,554
Please, sir.

646
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:02,438
The prosecution is targeting

647
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:04,012
Chairman Jang Tae Sik of S Group

648
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:07,327
over embezzlement, slush funds,
and improper lobbying with banks.

649
00:53:07,327 --> 00:53:09,118
The court will rule fairly,

650
00:53:09,118 --> 00:53:10,539
based on the law and the facts.

651
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:12,879
Please step back.

652
00:53:18,882 --> 00:53:20,841
Just one word, sir.

653
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,879
Hello, Justice.

654
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,148
You were appointed the same time as him?

655
00:53:31,148 --> 00:53:32,019
[Kim Yun Hyeok, Presiding Judge]

656
00:53:32,019 --> 00:53:33,904
Yes.
[Kim Yun Hyeok, Presiding Judge]

657
00:53:35,184 --> 00:53:37,297
Are you two close?

658
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:42,250
We're on decent terms.

659
00:53:44,114 --> 00:53:46,180
Good.

660
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,173
Aren't you curious...

661
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:52,151
who killed the S Construction CEO?

662
00:53:52,151 --> 00:53:53,659
It was because of
prosecutorial coercion, right?

663
00:53:53,659 --> 00:53:56,124
Some say he was driven to suicide.

664
00:53:56,124 --> 00:53:58,770
Then you should be out catching the killer.

665
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,179
What's the point?

666
00:54:01,179 --> 00:54:04,568
The court can just acquit him anyway.

667
00:54:04,568 --> 00:54:07,345
As long as you follow the law,

668
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:10,652
I'd beg on my knees if I had to.

669
00:54:10,652 --> 00:54:13,117
Oh, right.

670
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:14,685
Not you.

671
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:17,918
I should do that to Yoo Seon Cheol
at Haenal Law Firm.

672
00:54:18,607 --> 00:54:21,287
Are you out of your mind?

673
00:54:27,545 --> 00:54:28,689
These are the records of...

674
00:54:28,689 --> 00:54:31,509
Chairman Jang Tae Sik's
embezzlement and slush funds.

675
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,805
[Kim Yong Jin,
Accounting Director of S Construction]

676
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:43,530
They say you're obsessed with
indicting S Group.

677
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,996
Is that a prosecutor's duty,

678
00:54:44,996 --> 00:54:47,949
or a personal grudge?

679
00:54:48,683 --> 00:54:50,629
Both.

680
00:54:52,514 --> 00:54:56,140
I went after Jang Tae Sik
the moment I became a prosecutor.

681
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:05,158
You have impure motives.

682
00:55:22,468 --> 00:55:24,662
Let's grab lunch.

683
00:55:24,662 --> 00:55:26,621
I'm busy.

684
00:55:29,137 --> 00:55:32,418
This is complicated to handle, isn't it?

685
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:36,526
Not really.

686
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:43,763
Anything I can help with?

687
00:55:45,433 --> 00:55:47,486
You'll miss lunch.

688
00:55:47,486 --> 00:55:48,636
What about the ruling?

689
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,870
Yes.

690
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:52,023
The S Group's trial date is
the day after tomorrow...

691
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:53,355
So,

692
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:55,617
the draft ruling should be ready by now.

693
00:55:55,617 --> 00:55:58,774
I'll check it at his lunch.

694
00:55:58,774 --> 00:56:00,734
Okay.

695
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:08,807
You still here?

696
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:13,322
I'm heading out now.

697
00:56:27,272 --> 00:56:30,048
He is from a no-name school
with zero connections...

698
00:56:30,048 --> 00:56:33,341
Why did Haenal Law Firm
pick a guy like that?

699
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:35,807
I'm way better than him.

700
00:56:38,243 --> 00:56:40,937
It looks like the ruling on
Chairman Jang isn't ready yet.

701
00:56:40,937 --> 00:56:43,557
I'm kind of nervous.

702
00:57:00,945 --> 00:57:02,511
Finally...

703
00:57:02,511 --> 00:57:05,252
Are you heading to Haenal Law Firm?

704
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,008
Mr. Yoo,

705
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:22,886
it's me.

706
00:57:22,886 --> 00:57:25,634
Judge Lee Han Young submitted his resignation.

707
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:28,016
I thought you should know.

708
00:57:33,373 --> 00:57:34,399
Let's get dinner.

709
00:57:34,399 --> 00:57:36,096
Can't you eat without me?

710
00:57:36,096 --> 00:57:37,934
Not me.

711
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:40,047
With the Justice.

712
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,674
Thank you.

713
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,051
There's a senior judicial research clerk
at the Supreme Court

714
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:11,603
whose term is ending soon.

715
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:16,355
Once that seat opens,
it has to be filled immediately.

716
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:18,285
That's unfortunate.

717
00:58:18,285 --> 00:58:21,678
If I'd known earlier, I wouldn't have resigned.

718
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:25,370
You resigned?

719
00:58:26,858 --> 00:58:30,051
After work,
I stopped by the chief judge's office.

720
00:58:34,604 --> 00:58:37,410
Did Yoo Seon Cheol approve it?

721
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:42,773
Do you really think...

722
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:45,606
Yoo Seon Cheol approved?

723
00:58:49,095 --> 00:58:50,903
By now,

724
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:52,214
he probably knows.

725
00:58:52,214 --> 00:58:55,613
Your resignation won't be accepted
for the time being.

726
00:58:57,172 --> 00:58:58,532
Chief Justice Kang Shin Jin

727
00:58:58,532 --> 00:59:01,417
is very interested in this case.

728
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:07,687
The Supreme Court is bigger than
it looks from the outside.

729
00:59:07,687 --> 00:59:09,300
If you don't like the research post,

730
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,813
decide what you do want.

731
00:59:13,757 --> 00:59:17,030
While you prepare for the S Group trial.

732
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,841
The prosecution will reassign the case
after the first trial,

733
00:59:30,841 --> 00:59:34,657
and a different prosecutor will
handle the appeal.

734
00:59:34,657 --> 00:59:36,276
But...

735
00:59:36,276 --> 00:59:39,007
Judge Lee Han Young is the problem.

736
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:41,732
He turned down a Supreme Court post...

737
00:59:41,732 --> 00:59:43,833
and resigned.

738
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,685
Did he change that fast?

739
00:59:51,066 --> 00:59:53,535
This is getting messy.

740
01:00:02,245 --> 01:00:04,463
Hello, sir.

741
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:10,063
Looks like your son-in-law lacks
respect for his father-in-law.

742
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:13,278
[Haenal Law Firm]

743
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:23,112
Sit.

744
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:35,518
Do you only use your mouth in court?

745
01:00:35,518 --> 01:00:39,565
No greeting at all?
Like, "Sir, how have you been?"

746
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:41,645
Oh.

747
01:00:41,645 --> 01:00:44,611
Is it because I'm younger than you?

748
01:00:49,477 --> 01:00:51,837
Hello, sir.

749
01:00:51,837 --> 01:00:53,251
See? Much nicer.

750
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:55,849
A family greeting keeps
things nice and friendly.

751
01:00:55,849 --> 01:00:58,091
So, did you resign?

752
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:00,940
Yes.

753
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,238
Finish the S Group case,

754
01:01:03,238 --> 01:01:04,264
then come back.

755
01:01:04,264 --> 01:01:07,177
No. I'm going independent.

756
01:01:09,203 --> 01:01:12,123
Father, did you hear that?

757
01:01:14,415 --> 01:01:18,328
Did another firm make you an offer?

758
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:21,877
That'd be interesting.

759

Haenal's son-in-law working at another firm.

760

No.

761
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,981
Nothing like that.

762
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:33,855
We'll talk later.

This is for you.

What is this?

766
01:01:51,048 --> 01:01:53,988
The final ruling in the S Group case.

767
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:01,329
A judge's robe represents...

768
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:03,606
authority entrusted...

769
01:02:03,606 --> 01:02:06,506
by the people.

770
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:11,473
From now on,

771
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:15,983
Haenal Law Firm's power

772
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:18,375
will stand behind that authority.

773
01:02:27,971 --> 01:02:30,912
It's been ten years.

774
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:33,915
Living like a dog...

775
01:02:33,915 --> 01:02:36,592
on Haenal's leash.

776
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,343
Now...

777
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:43,488
you're forcing the ruling too?

778
01:02:43,488 --> 01:02:46,054
Finish this case...

779
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,073
and come back.

780
01:02:47,073 --> 01:02:48,283
I'll go independent.

781
01:02:48,283 --> 01:02:50,785
What changes if you're still
Haenal's son-in-law?

782
01:02:50,785 --> 01:02:53,379
Then I'll divorce.

783

Father.

784
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:59,686
That's why you don't let
a lapdog taste money.

785
01:03:01,629 --> 01:03:03,553
Lapdog...

786
01:03:03,553 --> 01:03:05,521
Whatever you do,

787
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:09,960
not until the S Group trial is over.

788
01:03:10,676 --> 01:03:12,872
Understand?

789
01:03:27,292 --> 01:03:30,094
My dealings with Haenal Law Firm

790
01:03:31,446 --> 01:03:33,744
end here.

791
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:05,510
Should we have a kid?

792
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,506
I'm not saying I'll carry one.

793
01:04:08,506 --> 01:04:10,031
Just bring one from somewhere.

794
01:04:10,031 --> 01:04:11,999
Let's get divorced.

795
01:04:15,963 --> 01:04:18,339
You seeing someone?

796
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:26,930
Just bring a kid.

797
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:30,077
If you don't have one, start trying now.

798
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:36,138
A daughter would be nice.

799
01:04:41,088 --> 01:04:43,811
I told your father.

800
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,480
You can't divorce me.

801
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,620
Divorce happens...

802
01:05:03,831 --> 01:05:07,304
when I decide it does.

803
01:05:10,093 --> 01:05:11,684
Don't come home

804
01:05:11,684 --> 01:05:13,117
until I say...

805
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,517
you can.

I lived like a loser.

809
01:05:57,169 --> 01:06:01,062
You bastard, just drop dead!

810
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:05,926
What?

811
01:06:05,926 --> 01:06:06,956
Hey.

812
01:06:06,956 --> 01:06:09,262
What did you just say?

813
01:06:09,262 --> 01:06:10,610
What did you just say?

814
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:11,988
- Don't.
- Let go!

815
01:06:11,988 --> 01:06:14,654
Drop dead, you bastard!

816
01:06:17,778 --> 01:06:20,138
You're nothing.

817
01:06:21,554 --> 01:06:22,612
Hey!

818
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,065
Hey, stop it.

819
01:06:24,065 --> 01:06:25,383
Stop.

820
01:06:25,383 --> 01:06:27,562
Hey, stop it.

821
01:06:27,562 --> 01:06:30,201
Enough. Come here.

822
01:06:30,797 --> 01:06:32,677
Let's just go.

823
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,058
The granddaughter downstairs
took her own life.

824
01:07:26,058 --> 01:07:27,984
The plaintiffs' claims are...

825
01:07:27,984 --> 01:07:30,150
Some damn judge...

826
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:32,734
- Dismissed.
- pushed a dying person over the edge.

827
01:07:32,734 --> 01:07:34,485
Not guilty?

828
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:35,737
How is he innocent?

829
01:07:35,737 --> 01:07:37,947
That's why you don't let a lapdog taste money.

830
01:07:37,947 --> 01:07:41,316
What kind of heartless law is this?

831
01:07:41,316 --> 01:07:43,969
How are we supposed to live
with this injustice?

832
01:07:43,969 --> 01:07:46,928
I can't live with this.

833
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,562
How did my son end up like this?

834
01:08:44,677 --> 01:08:47,223
It's time. Why isn't he here yet?

835
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:50,335
He'll be in any moment.

836
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:52,654
If the people taking my money worked like this,

837
01:08:52,654 --> 01:08:54,598
they'd all be finished.

838
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:57,165
Of course. I know.

839
01:09:00,422 --> 01:09:03,307
All rise.

840
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:19,241
Please be seated.

841
01:09:29,618 --> 01:09:31,353
The defendant, Jang Tae Sik,

842
01:09:31,353 --> 01:09:33,190
is merely a victim of

843
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:36,283
the reckless and immoral embezzlement
and slush fund schemes

844
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:39,184
carried out by S Construction
CEO Choi Jong Hak.

845
01:09:39,184 --> 01:09:41,290
However,

846
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:43,358
an employee's wrongdoing is...

847
01:09:43,358 --> 01:09:47,636
ultimately the chairman's responsibility.

848
01:09:47,636 --> 01:09:50,083
I repent.

849
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:01,153
For the past ten years,

850
01:10:01,153 --> 01:10:03,639
the defendant used S Construction

851
01:10:03,639 --> 01:10:05,207
as a vehicle for embezzlement

852
01:10:05,207 --> 01:10:08,451
and slush funds.

853
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:11,317
Also, now seeks to pin his crimes...

854
01:10:11,317 --> 01:10:13,951
on the late CEO Choi Jong Hak.

855
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:18,773
Accordingly, the prosecution,

856
01:10:18,773 --> 01:10:22,551
under the Act on Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Economic Crimes,

857
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,152
seeks a sentence of...

858
01:10:25,152 --> 01:10:27,259
six years in prison

859
01:10:27,259 --> 01:10:29,403
and a fine of 12 billion won

860
01:10:29,403 --> 01:10:31,818
for the defendant, Jang Tae Sik.

861
01:10:33,706 --> 01:10:35,882
Don't worry.

862
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,807
Defendant, please stand.

863
01:11:21,103 --> 01:11:23,090
The court orders.

864
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:27,326
The defendant, Jang Tae Sik,

865
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:36,624
is sentenced to ten years in prison

866
01:11:36,624 --> 01:11:38,996
and a fine of 24 billion won.

867
01:11:38,996 --> 01:11:42,029
The defendant is taken into custody.

868
01:11:44,529 --> 01:11:47,396
What? What just happened?

869
01:11:53,345 --> 01:11:56,374
Did you hear that? Ten years.

870
01:11:56,374 --> 01:11:58,787
Why such a nice ruling?

871
01:11:58,787 --> 01:12:01,984
Is there anyone to notify
of the defendant's detention?

872
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,796
Has he lost his mind?

873
01:12:03,796 --> 01:12:05,569
Hey, come down here!

874
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:07,049
- What? Detention?
- Please calm down.

875
01:12:07,049 --> 01:12:08,242
Ten years?

876
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:10,344
Let go of me! Are you kidding me?

877
01:12:10,344 --> 01:12:11,795
Judge Lee!

878
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:13,420
Redo this!

879
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,326
Hey!

880
01:13:01,474 --> 01:13:04,084
Do you know what you just did?

881
01:13:04,084 --> 01:13:05,231
Tell them to appeal.

882
01:13:05,231 --> 01:13:07,377
What? This punk.

883
01:13:16,235 --> 01:13:18,688
What the hell are you doing?

884
01:13:22,217 --> 01:13:25,076
Ridiculous.

885
01:13:25,076 --> 01:13:27,944
Did you want a divorce that badly?

886
01:13:30,085 --> 01:13:32,637
I'll send the papers.

887
01:13:55,186 --> 01:13:57,840
[Defendant's Seat]

888
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:05,328
The defendant, Lee Han Young,

889
01:14:05,328 --> 01:14:08,394
is charged with murdering an accomplice

890
01:14:08,394 --> 01:14:10,462
and issuing threats.

891
01:14:10,462 --> 01:14:13,007
The prosecution hereby brings charges

892
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:15,843
against the defendant, Lee Han Young.

893
01:14:15,843 --> 01:14:17,077
Defendant,

894
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:19,776
do you admit to the charges?

895
01:14:32,141 --> 01:14:33,584
No. No.

896
01:14:33,584 --> 01:14:35,927
No!

897
01:14:35,927 --> 01:14:38,132
Defendant.

898
01:14:38,132 --> 01:14:40,233
It wasn't me!

899
01:14:45,329 --> 01:14:47,770
No.

900
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:49,494
I...

901
01:14:49,494 --> 01:14:52,421
I am not guilty.

902
01:14:53,095 --> 01:14:55,708
I'm not guilty!

903
01:14:56,381 --> 01:14:59,293
I'm not guilty.

904
01:15:30,177 --> 01:15:32,187
I'll prove my own innocence.

905
01:15:32,187 --> 01:15:34,057
You can't handle this alone.

906
01:15:34,057 --> 01:15:35,129
You piece of trash!

907
01:15:35,129 --> 01:15:37,728
This is what happens when trash plays judge!

908
01:15:37,728 --> 01:15:39,114
I finally want to live...

909
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:42,145
as the real Lee Han Young.

910
01:15:42,145 --> 01:15:43,389
2025?

911
01:15:43,389 --> 01:15:45,758
I'm back exactly ten years.

912
01:15:45,758 --> 01:15:47,173
Kim Sang Jin?

913
01:15:47,173 --> 01:15:49,056
Arrest him now.
If you don't, that child will die.

914
01:15:49,056 --> 01:15:51,080
- How do you know that?
- Didn't you read the case file?

915
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,437
You released him.

916
01:15:52,437 --> 01:15:53,757
I have a child.

917
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:54,910
Right. I'm a judge.

918
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:56,847
Then try Kim Sang Jin with me.

919
01:15:56,847 --> 01:16:00,200
I have to prove he's a serial killer.
